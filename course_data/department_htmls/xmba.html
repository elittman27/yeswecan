This course introduces the world of operational and strategic turnarounds of troubled and underperforming businesses. It focuses on the leadership practices that work in fixing flawed enterprises, from underperforming businesses to those on the brink of a death spiral. Most time in the course is spent learning how to more effectively lead companies that are underperforming or in trouble. The course is taught by cases, with the view that the best way to learn leadership</span><span class="deschide"> is by taking the perspective of business leaders facing crises that demand new direction.

This course aims to improve the quality of decisions people make. Students learn to be aware of, and to avoid, common inferential errors and systematic biases in decision making. There are many decision traps that we tend to repeatedly fall into. These traps relate to how we think about risk and probability, how we learn from experience, and how we make choices. Upon completion, students will have internalized the basic principles of decision making and will be</span><span class="deschide"> able to avoid falling into these traps. The course additionally aims to create a deeper understanding of the psychology of decision making, which can create an advantage in negotiations and other interactions through gaining an awareness of the predictable mistakes of others.</span><br />

We are in the midst of a digital transformation that is changing how industries work and how we will live and work.

The objective of this course is to help students become better leaders by strengthening their ability to build trust-based relationships with others such as direct reports, supervisors, peers and customers. The course draws appropriate links back to Leadership Communications and forward to Applied Innovation. Students will (i) debrief their experience of putting learning from Leadership Communications into action in their workplace; (ii) practice various approaches</span><span class="deschide"> to honing their empathy, including the use of insightful questions rather than assertions as the basis for a dialogue with others; and (iii) learn a simple peer coaching model that they will use in between face-to-face sessions with their classmates.</span><br />

This course intends to help students apply the skills of applied innovation in a loosely-structured, open-ended project. Students will learn advanced techniques in the innovation process and apply it to a project of their choice. The course is loosely structured and includes a lot of coaching time with faculty, as well as feedback and critique time with peers. The course largely follows the innovation cycle — observe and notice, frame and reframe, imagine and design</span><span class="deschide">, and make and test — but does so nonlinearly.</span><br />

This course combines high-impact visits with founders/CEOs and targeted case studies on entrepreneurship. Founder visits provide perspectives on current events in Silicon Valley, as well as opportunities to engage with entrepreneurs on a deeply personal level. Founders will present an overview of their company, followed by a Q&amp;A session. Case studies will focus on the role of experimentation and uncertainty in successful businesses, and will draw on frameworks</span><span class="deschide"> in strategy, finance, and negotiation.</span><br />

Students learn about the key strategic choices that shape whether companies deliver real value to stakeholders. They are taught to organize the strategic choices into four different strategy “playbooks” that they can use to systematically consider alternate strategies for a startup, and the core elements needed to make these strategies work: Intellectual Property Strategy, Disruptive Strategy, Value Chain Strategy, and Architectural Strategy. Students must (a) analyze</span><span class="deschide"> cases, thinking systematically through what they would do if they were a founder or early-employee in the protagonists’ shoes; (b) engage in class discussions, treating the classroom as a laboratory; and (c) formulate a real strategic plan for a final strategy assignment.</span><br />
