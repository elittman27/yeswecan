In the years 2020-22, the world was in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet there is a much more devastating disaster on the horizon: the global environmental crisis. Some of its consequences are apparent already, including fire and flooding (and the proliferation of pandemics). This course will consider these two crises – and disasters in general – from the standpoint of knowledge and action. Put differently, how aware are we about looming disasters, how do we</span><span class="deschide"> assess them, and what do we do about them.

Society is ordered by age. Age is not the only ordering dimension of society, but it is a central one. A life course perspective represents a sociological way of understanding how age structures society. Our lives progress through a sequence of socially constructed stages—childhood, adolescence, middle adulthood, and later adulthood. A life course perspective is particularly interested in the rules and norms that govern transitions between</span><span class="deschide"> these stages.</span><br />

Leadership has many meanings in society. What works well in one context cannot always be applied in another. And contexts have history. What works well in one domain does not necessarily work for all time. In this course we will reflect on the meaning of leadership in society. Our focus will be modern ideas of leadership, and how these ideas evolved, succeeded or failed in moments of social change. We will read in the area of organizational</span><span class="deschide"> sociology with a focus on interactions, institutions and culture. In addition, we will consider work from political science, management studies and history as we attempt to unravel what leadership looks like across a variety of social domains in different states of change.</span><br />

This course first begins with a brief sketch of the core climate challenges. Then, through a reading of The Human Planet, it undertakes a more holistic, historical approach, which we continue through classic and new work on Black Reconstruction and Indingeous struggles. The historical re-grounding makes up the first half of the class. The second half of the class surveys some of the leading social science, especially sociology, on the climate</span><span class="deschide"> crisis, building on that broader foundation.

The underlying principle of meritocracy is that everyone should have an equal opportunity to put their life plans in action. When structural barriers get in the way of such human flourishing, we think of them as unjust. Being in good health and of sound mind are two core requirements of a life well-lived. Without them, all other attempts at fair play (such as those in the distribution of income and other valued resources) are likely to fail.</span><span class="deschide"> It makes good sense, therefore, to pay close attention to the relationship between health and wealth. Such a study has important scholarly and policy implications. We will participate in precisely this kind of inquiry during the semester.

Social Theory began as an attempt to come to grips with the massive social transformations in Europe beginning around 1500. Modernity was understood in three ways. It concerned the development of a capitalist economy based on the use of science to develop new technology, the emergence of states with bureaucracies allied with military organizations, and the decline of religious authority as the main arbiter of moral values accompanied by the rise</span><span class="deschide"> of the model of the self-interested purposive actor. Social theory was produced not just to create an understanding of these changes and the problems they caused, but also to be used to propose how society ought to be structured. In this class, we examine how classical thinkers, like Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim among others, proposed how to analyze those changes and in doing so created theories of society.</span><br />

This course is a continuation of our required graduate theory course. We separate modern and classical social theory by considering modern social theory to consist of works published after World War II. Modern sociological theory uses classical social theory both as a source and a foil. There have been continuities in social thought whereby more contemporary theorists view themselves as using elements of classical social theory, sometimes</span><span class="deschide"> in combination and at other times to understand different kinds of phenomena, such as micro-interaction or gender relations. Contemporary theory has also been critical of classical theory. This has caused different theorists to construct entirely new ideas or rely on new sources for their theories. The course considers a wide variety of authors and perspectives to illustrate the current breadth of social thought.</span><br />

In this graduate-level research methods course we will revisit and extend many of the issues with<br/>
which you have dealt in conducting your MA and possibly other research. Further, some issues<br/>
that bear on your (and everyone’s) research will be brought into our discussion. As we revisit,<br/>
extend, and broaden the material of methods, students can use their research experience to<br/>
interrogate the conflicting ideas of the course</span><span class="deschide">, and use various conflicting ideas of the course to<br/>

To move forward, we need to supplement natural science with social science. This course is a survey of key research topics in climate and environmental sociology tuned to the</span><span class="deschide"> pressing effort to understand the core social (and political, and economic) dimensions of this crisis, and the extent to which these are (or are not) novel dynamics. Put another way: how much continuity, and how much change, is there in the climate emergency?</span><br />

In this course we address a wide range of social theories and sociological investigations of sexuality as it is conceptualized and experienced in social contexts. Theoretical approaches to sexuality may include psychoanalytic, feminist, Marxist, symbolic-interactionist, and discursive/post-structural approaches to understanding how sexual categories vary over time and across cultures, how people identify with or against them, and how social power</span><span class="deschide"> works through time.</span><br />

This seminar examines the dynamics of migration, integration, and citizenship, both from the perspective of the receiving society and from the lived experiences of migrants themselves. The seminar focuses on processes of incorporation--economic, social, cultural, and political--but we also look at paradigms that challenge an integrationist reading of migration, in particular transnationalism and models of postnational citizenship.</span><br />
