This course will involve a real world site to provide students with the experience and skills necessary to synthesize real estate development + design projects. As developers and designers, students need to understand: the development process, program, how development teams work, what makes good design and how it adds value, and how to propose a feasible, innovative project from multiple constraints. Students will learn how to gather and evaluate market, construction</span><span class="deschide">, and environmental data to inform design choices; evaluate the physical, market, and public policy constraints of a given site; apply best practices of redevelopment; advance innovative design solutions, and communicate their development proposal to a professional audience.</span><br/>
