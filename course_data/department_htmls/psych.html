The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br />

The goal of this course is to give students a strong foundation in statistical methodologies prevalent in the psychological sciences, and to prepare them for more advanced and specialized courses in statistics, machine learning, and data science. This course will cover fundamental principles underlying common statistical methods, as well as specific statistical models, largely centered around the General Linear Model, ranging from t-tests to multilevel</span><span class="deschide"> models. All analyses will be conducted in the statistical programming language R.</span><br />

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues. This learning goal will not be emphasized in the class but students will learn how to formulate a psychological principle in terms of a particular model. This formulation is key to identify how particular problems observed in the student’s everyday life could be analyzed.<br/>
Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling. This is the central learning goal of this class.<br/>
Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological). Although, we might be using examples from different areas of psychology, the student will not gain a major understanding of these content areas in this course.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data. In this class, students will learn the current approaches in statistical modeling but these will be related to the more traditional statistics that have been used in the field in prior years giving the students a historical perspective.<br/>
Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media. In this course, the students will learn not only how to formulate competing hypothesis and generate the corresponding statistical models but also how to best interpret the results from these quantitative analyses so that they can be communicated in written form in publication format or in spoken form for presentations. These skills are critical for the evaluation of scientific work and conclusions performed by experts in the field and others.<br/>
Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature. The students will not make a formal oral presentation during this class but will be asked during lecture and section to orally explain their results and reasoning. The final written project is designed to teach how to write-up quantitative analyses and statistical reasoning within a longer manuscript analyzing a particular question in the field of psychology.<br/>
Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines. Scientific enquiry in Social Sciences and in Psychology in particular is based on the formulation of statistical models. Each scientific hypothesis corresponds to a particular model and hypothesis testing involves comparing models in terms of their predictive power. The field of psychology, because of the complexity of the data it attempts to explain relies heavily (and more so that other biological disciplines) on statistical modeling and other quantitative approaches. Students who desire to pursue a scientific career in psychology need to be well trained in these methods.</p></div>

This course provides a comprehensive overview of behavorial endocrinology beginning with hormone production and actions on target issues and continuing with an exploration of a variety of behaviors and their hormonal regulation/consequences. The course uses a comparative approach to examine the reciprocal interactions between the neuroendocrine system and behavior, considering the effects of hormone on development and adult behavior in addition</span><span class="deschide"> to how behavior regulates endocrine physiology. While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate.

In this course, we examine the developmental trajectories that lead to mental illness in young children by: 1) understanding abnormal development in the context of normal development, and vice versa; 2) using a developmental approach to identify continuities and discontinuities; 3) addressing how mental illness develops and why; 4) learning the role genes and contexts of development play; 5) investigating multiple levels</span><span class="deschide">, and the dynamic reciprocal transactions among them; and 6) applying our knowledge to children’s real-world experiences, to better understand the mental illness, its mechanisms, and its challenges.</span><br />

Global mental health seeks to alleviate suffering caused by mental disorders globally. Although most of the world lives in low-and-middle income countries, the majority of mental health resources are concentrated in high-income countries. Therefore, we focus on the mental health burden in low-resource settings. Through primary articles and recent chapters, this course integrates the scientific</span><span class="deschide"> evidence, cultural and contextual nuances, and interdisciplinary approaches of global mental health.</span><br />

This lecture and small group activity course will examine the development of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8—in the varied contexts in which development occurs. The course is designed to introduce the basic theories and the research approaches that have been used to develop them. We will also explore how the contexts, the influences of environments in which children are growing and living, affect their</span><span class="deschide"> development and our understanding of children. We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br />

This seminar will examine the developmental context of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8. The course is designed to introduce research on how individual, family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts influence children’s development and learning. We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare</span><span class="deschide">, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.<br/></span><br />

This course will teach a human-centered, evidence-based method for finding new ways to solve persistent problems: Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a methodology for collaborative problem solving pioneered at the design firm IDEO and Stanford University to come up with game-changing solutions to difficult problems. As student learners accustomed to taking others’ perspectives and problem solving, we are especially well-suited to use Design</span><span class="deschide"> Thinking.<br/>
We will be tackling the problem of children’s school readiness. The goal of this class is to find imaginative and practical solutions -- imaginative enough to be exciting and effective for children and families, and practical enough to be able to pilot these solutions during the class.<br/></span><br />

This seminar examines how the diverse policy contexts in which children are born and raised have dramatic implications for their life trajectories. We will explore how, when and why government intervenes in children’s lives, through family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts, aiming to improve their developmental trajectories. From this basis, we investigate the effects of policies on children locally</span><span class="deschide">, nationally, and internationally. Drawing from a variety of case studies and empirical research, students will gain a deep understanding of policy goals, development, implementation, and implications. After gaining familiarity with early childhood policies, students will develop their own early childhood policy.</span><br />

This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to an understanding of happiness. We will first review the different treatments of happiness in the world’s philosophical traditions: conceptions of the good life in classical Greek and Judeo-Christian thought, the great East Asian philosophies, and ideas about happiness that emerged in the age of Enlightenment. With these different</span><span class="deschide"> perspectives as a framework, the course will turn to treatments of happiness in the behavioral sciences, evolutionary scholarship, and neuroscience. Special Emphasis will be given to understanding how happiness arises in experiences of the moral emotions, including gratitude, compassion, reverence and awe, and aesthetic emotions like humor and beauty.</span><br />

The course will review research on culture, race, and ethnicity and will consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in American society. Mounting evidence suggests that psychological processes are culture-specific, theory-driven, and context-dependent. This course will focus on the effects that theories of mind, person</span><span class="deschide">, self, and social institutions have on human cognition, motivation, emotion, and social interactions in American society. Students will gain a better appreciation of the ways that cultural traditions and social practices regulate and transform psychological functioning.

We will teach you how to work with data and code to get a deeper understanding of how fMRI methods work, how they can fail, how to fix them, and how to develop new methods. We will cover the basic concepts in neuroimaging analysis, and how they relate to the wider world of statistics, engineering and computer science. At the same time we will teach you techniques</span><span class="deschide"> of data analysis that will make your work easier to organize, understand, explain and share.
