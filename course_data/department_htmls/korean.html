This course aims to facilitate critical understanding of persistent themes and diverse styles of modern Korean literature through close readings of canonical works from the colonial period (1910-1945). It encourages students to develop broad comprehension of “post-colonial” characteristics of Korean literature. Concurrently, it explores how Korean literature aspired to the expression of the universal aesthetic values and judgment against</span><span class="deschide"> the particularistic historical condition of colonialism.</span><br />

This course aims to provide a high-fidelity musical history of Korea’s long 20th century. Starting at the tail end of the Chosŏn Dynasty in the late 19th century with Korean folksongs, we will proceed to catalogue the changing dynamics of Korean popular music as it encountered and remixed Western forms, and examine these different musical genres in their socio-historical context. No musical background or Korean language proficiency is required. All readings will</span><span class="deschide"> be in English, although students will acquire some familiarity with Korean language through abundant listening selections and lyric analysis.</span><br />

This course examines Korean literature from the fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries through the perspectives of gender. Although the modern discourse of enlightenment in Korea, beginning in the early twentieth century, has been sharply critical of gender inequality in premodern Korea, the gender relations represented in premodern Korean literature are much more complex and dynamic than we might expect. To revise our understanding of gender in premodern Korea</span><span class="deschide">, this course seeks to examine how gender is imagined particularly in terms of the body, bodily practice, and theatrical performance.</span><br />
