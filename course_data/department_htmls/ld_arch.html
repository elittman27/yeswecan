This is an undergraduate studio with a central focus on climate modification for energy conservation. We will research historical precedents in order to develop new garden forms for passive green designs. We will also explore how past cultures integrated metaphysics into their gardens as an adjunct to microclimate and habitat design. The contemporary landscape should be a balanced interweaving of proportion, function, comfort, energy conservation</span><span class="deschide">, and enlightenment. Additionally, we will study the choreography of space and investigate how to animate the landscape through the creative interpretation of text and film. Many new and exciting opportunities lie ahead for the creation of garden forms that not only conserve energy, but are also works of art and places of spiritual renewal.</span><br />

This course focuses on natural factors of the environment that are fundamental to ecosystem management, land use planning and landscape design and their relationships to one another in different terrestrial ecosystems, from predominantly natural to predominantly anthropogenic. Lectures explore the key concepts on ecosystem structure, function and dynamics and discuss different types of ecological data, their interpretation and visualization that</span><span class="deschide"> can aid in landscape research, planning and design workflow. Laboratory sections advance lecture topics by providing hands-on training in common types of ecosystem analyses using quantitative methods and geospatial tools.</span><br />

The course stresses motives and values expressed through environmental design at various scales – from neighborhood to global and examines problems affecting healthy environments</span><span class="deschide"> and their solutions. Students study the need for protection and restoration of healthy ecological systems within the design of cities and landscapes and discuss ways to enable these systems to thrive.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> This course is an important elective to majors in the College of Natural Resources and CED students who have Architecture and City Planning majors. A new CED major, Sustainable Environmental Design (SED), has increased the number of students who require this class. It also fulfills the Social and Behavioral breadth requirement. Therefore, it is clear that the course enrollment should be increased to accommodate students from both inside and outside the CED.<br/>
This course offers students the opportunity to examine a specific range of sustainable design interventions that attempt to address primary problems related to climate change, the need for healthy watersheds, adequate food security and socially resilient communities in the face of rapid environmental change. Students will see the complexity of various aspects and approaches required of sustainable design and occasionally competing goals of a project.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> On the required field trip to San Francisco, students will be able to see and critique the efficacy of policy; of existing and emerging landscape design technology; to observe interventions intended to assist existing natural systems in urban environments and promote their viability; to see the value of community building to help establish resilient neighborhoods; to become verbally articulate about these issues.<br/>
Students will learn about and discuss the inter-connectedness of natural systems overlapped by human habitation. They will learn about design that can facilitate positive social systems and how the combination of ecological and social communities can present answers to some of the pressing environmental problems we face. Students will learn how various design strategies involve land preservation, watershed protection and restoration; local food production networks; resilient neighborhood design through community participation in open space design; pedestrian and bicycle friendly streets, urban forestry; reducing the waste stream.</p></div>

This course provides instruction and guidance in the professional practice aspect of landscape architecture in the United States. Covering the breadth of the profession, we will learn the professional duties of a landscape architect, and the process of completing a real-life landscape architectural project. The goal of this class will be to learn what it means to be a practicing, licensed landscape architect, with the understanding that this</span><span class="deschide"> is ultimately a construction based, service-oriented industry.</span><br />

Representations typically demonstrate two different forms of landscape analysis—empirical data and personal perception/aesthetics—but landscape provides opportunities for their overlaps in order to advance and synthesize robust research. Through lectures, technical tutorials, and reading discussions, this course will profile contemporary landscape research practices and representational techniques. We will use visualization to advance landscape research, theory</span><span class="deschide">, and site analysis, focusing specifically on methods that tackle issues of temporality and ephemerality.

This course is a laboratory for design thinking, invention and visual perception. A designed landscape has the potential to induce a powerful emotional experience. The premise of this course is based on the idea that highly valued places are works of art, as well as places of enlightenment and transformation. This class will explore ideas of ‘sacredness’ in the landscape through a series of design explorations and a summation project. Our journey</span><span class="deschide"> of discovery aspires to provide future landscape architects with a new and unique perspective to help them recognize and generate sacred landscapes. Design Thinking will outline a process for creative practice that builds upon historic approaches while imagining new possibilities.</span><br />

This course provides instruction and guidance in the professional practice aspect of landscape architecture in the United States. Covering the breadth of the profession, we will learn the professional duties of a landscape architect, and the process of completing a real-life landscape architectural project. The goal of this class will be to learn what it means to be a practicing, licensed landscape architect, with the understanding that this</span><span class="deschide"> is ultimately a construction based, service-oriented industry.</span><br />

Representations typically demonstrate two different forms of landscape analysis—empirical data and personal perception/aesthetics—but landscape provides opportunities for their overlaps in order to advance and synthesize robust research. Through lectures, technical tutorials, and reading discussions, this course will profile contemporary landscape research practices and representational techniques. We will use visualization to advance landscape</span><span class="deschide"> research, theory, and site analysis, focusing specifically on methods that tackle issues of temporality and ephemerality.
