This course will study the end of life--dying and death--from the perspective of medicine and history. It seeks to confront the humanist with the quotidian dilemmas of modern clinical practice and medicine's deep engagement with death more generally. It invites pre-med, pre-law, and public policy students to understand these matters in light of the historical and, more broadly, literary and artistic perspectives</span><span class="deschide"> of the humanities.</span><br />

The focus of this course is on medical physiology—the study of the human body's normal functioning. Physiology underpins the rest of the foundational medical sciences curriculum by allowing students to map and anchor the additional learning necessary to make sense of complex problem-based learning (PBL) medical cases later in the curriculum. Students will learn physiology through team-based learning (TBL), a student-centered pedagogy in which they</span><span class="deschide"> work with physiological problems to solve them collaboratively. By actively engaging in learning through problem-solving, students do more than memorize content; they learn how to work together to build a strong web of interconnected information to solve real-world problems.</span><br />
