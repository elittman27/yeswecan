This course focuses on relationships between diet and health, and responses of the human body to diet and food components, including macro and micro nutrients, water, phytochemicals, and alcohol. This course also provides an overview of the interplay between nutrients and physiological and behavioral responses. Lectures, which address contributions of diet to optimal health or disease risk, are based on current nutritional</span><span class="deschide">, biochemical, and medical knowledge. Goals include enabling students to make informed decisions about their nutritional needs and current issues concerning nutrition.</span><br />

The course will center on how the body processes nutrients, as well as other components of diet such as water, alcohol, and plant constituents. We will explore how these processes can have a lasting effect on our health and behavior. Students will gain a general understanding of basic human nutrition, how key biological, physical, social and psychological factors affect how we eat. The goal is that students gain sufficient knowledge to be</span><span class="deschide"> able to make informed dietary choices based on individual nutritional needs, and to understand how these choices can have a long lasting impact on one's life. The lecture will be delivered in two modalities 1) In-person lectures 2) Lectures will be streamed and recorded for viewing later.</span><br />
