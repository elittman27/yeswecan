How can genetics help increase the food supply even as farmland conditions degrade? How genetically unique are humans? What do buzzwords like GWAS and epigenetics refer to, and how are they impacting medicine and public health? This introductory course for non-science majors will explore topics like these as students learn the foundations of scientific reasoning, genetics concepts and approaches, and their promise and limits in addressing societal</span><span class="deschide"> challenges past and present. Objectives include learning fundamentals of biology and their applications; building students’ capacity to make informed interpretations of experimental data and policies involving “genetics” in a changing world; and to understand our place in nature.</span><br />

This course will provide a comparative overview of virus life cycles and strategies viruses use to infect and replicate in hosts. We will discuss virus structure and classification and the molecular basis of viral reproduction, evolution, assembly, and virus-host interactions. Common features used during virus replication and host cellular responses to infection will be covered. Topics also included are common and emerging virus diseases</span><span class="deschide">, their control, and factors affecting their spread.</span><br />

This course offers a consideration of genes, enzymes, metabolic pathways and biochemical processes leading to the generation of hydrogen, bio-oils, ethanol, and other biofuels. Discussion of biochemistry is extended to cover product yields and techno-economic analyses of commercial viability of the various biofuel products. Lectures are based on historical and contemporary papers in plant and microbial biochemistry, integrating structure</span><span class="deschide">, function and evolution of the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, and discussing how this knowledge can be applied in the generation of renewable biofuels.</span><br />
