What is access? In this course, students will refine their definition of educational access and learn about the paradigm of universal design, a set of principles originally developed to ensure that the built environment was accessible to all. Universal design has expanded to apply to learning contexts. Educators, in addition to applying universal design to tangible aspects of the learning environment, are also</span><span class="deschide"> applying it to intangible elements (curriculum, teaching philosophy and practices, etc.) in order to create barrier-free learning environments that serve diverse student populations.

The goal of equality has long dominated social and political discourse in the United States. This goal has struggled alongside our nation’s professed commitment to diversity – diversity of race, ethnicity, class, language, culture, ability, and religion (among many others). Public schools are arguably the primary arena within which efforts to nurture equality and diversity have been focused and challenged. The schools, and the myriad educational</span><span class="deschide"> contexts beyond them, play a central role in the organization of inequality. At the same time, they also offer the potential for increased opportunity and equity.</span><br />

American sports and athletes have come to signify a complex of variegated meanings that include desire, but also disdain. Through the work of a variety of scholars, researchers, and journalists, this course explores the nature and motives of societal structures and practices (embodied in both institutions and individuals) to illuminate the intersections and reciprocal influences of society and sports. The central framework of this course draws</span><span class="deschide"> on the notion that the space of sports is defined by highly structured societal practices and consumptions. By critically analyzing a variety of these practices, this course attempts to ground a partial reading of other societal forces in American culture. In particular, the course examines the nuanced intersections of sport, race, ethnicity, social class and gender, highlighting the ways in which American sports provide a potential vehicle for social mobility and integration while simultaneously reproducing existing cultural stereotypes and structures of inequality.</span><br />

This course combines theory and practice in the study of literacy and development, while simultaneously introducing students to socio-cultural educational theory and research. This research perspicaciously and critically analyzes extant literature on literacy teaching and learning. This literature will be examined in practice through participation in tutoring and technology-oriented</span><span class="deschide"> summer programs. In addition, this course satisfies the American Cultures requirement and will contribute to understanding of race, cultures, and ethnicity in the United States. We will develop a view of literacy, not as a neutral skill, but as embedded within culture and as depending for its meaning and its practice upon social institutions and conditions. In addition to lecture, students are to participate in field work hours.</span><br />

The course will trace the genealogy of educational curriculum reform movements and draw parallels to how students with disabilities have been excluded from physical, social, and sports opportunities within educational spaces historically. Particular focus will be placed on the student body at the intersection of sport and school, analyzing the historical and controversial relationship between athletics and American educational institutions. A critical component</span><span class="deschide"> of the course requires students to participate in an engaged scholarship experience with our local non-profit partners.

This course will focus on understanding urban schools as a part of a broader system of social stratification and the process by which students in urban schools come to a sense of themselves as students, as members of cultural and racial groups, and as young people in America. Topics include racial identity; race/ethnicity in schools; urban neighborhood contexts; and schooling in the juvenile justice system. Students will also integrate course readings</span><span class="deschide"> with their own first-hand experience working in one of several off-campus sites.

This course is a doctoral seminar in developmental psychology, with a broad focus on psychosocial development and its impact on children in educational contexts. The course begins with a discussion of Erikson's psychosocial theory and the sociocultural perspectives of Vygotsky and other theorists. We then review some of the major psychosocial variables related to educational achievement, including competence, motivation, self-concept, self-efficacy</span><span class="deschide">, self-regulation, and volition. We touch briefly on moral development and values as psychosocial factors affecting correlates. We examine (a) how social and personal identity factors are used to explain underachievement (e.g., cultural ecological theory and stereotype threat), (b) the role of identity in different cultural groups, (c) the impact of these factors on teacher and student behavior, and (d) the role that identity plays in helping students develop a sense of future.</span><br />

Developmental Psychopathology, which is the study of psychological problems in the context of human development. Students will examine theories and research that seek to explain the developmental origins and pathways by which psychopathology develops during childhood and adolescence. A wide range of influences relevant to the etiology and presentation of psychological and behavioral disorders-biological, cognitive, social, and environmental/societal-will</span><span class="deschide"> be explored. In addition to childhood precursors of mental health disorders, students will also learn about the developmental consequences of such conditions. Students will also become familiar with the diagnostic criterion for the most common disorder in childhood and adolescence.</span><br />

This class is the second in the two-course series that is grounded in a critical understanding of California’s 2016 History-Social Science Framework with the goal of articulating a history-social science pedagogy that humanizes and empowers all students. Our year-long course question is: How can robust history-social science instruction support our students to connect their lives to the past, develop as critical thinkers about past, present</span><span class="deschide">, and future challenges, and take actions towards a more just and democratic world? This semester in particular aims to deepen pre-service teachers’ understanding of the range of ways scholars have conceptualized U.S. history, world history, economics and civics.</span><br />

Curriculum Development and Design’s central challenge is to create curriculum that expresses your philosophy and knowledge of curriculum and teaching. Using the practical and conceptual tools that you have learned in your coursework and your experience in the field, you will design a unit for your students. The unit will teach significant conceptual understandings and skills while supporting students’ academic language development as well as other</span><span class="deschide"> needs and interests. We will draw on Wiggins and McTighe’s model of “backward design” to guide us through this process.</span><br />

Many approaches to education take the knowledge to be taught as fixed, and the manipulable objects to be things like methods.

Throughout the lifespan we are socialized through language to become competent participants and members of various groups and communities, including schooling institutions.

The study of narrative has solidified into an important body of literature that is of particular relevance to educators. Across learning contexts, narrative is a ubiquitous literacy tool, and as such, it underlies many learning activities. We tell narratives for their potency to explain, rationalize, and delineate past, present, and possible experience. This narrative act is a collaborative undertaking, co-told and designed with the audience's</span><span class="deschide"> input, addressing an audience's present and future concerns. Narrative can thus potentially create shared understandings and community among those participating in narrative activity, yet narratives can become sites for rejection and contestation. Narrative is also a socializing tool. The course will also address methodological approaches to the study of narrative that are relevant to the field of education. Students enrolled in this course are expected to collect narrative samples from naturally occurring interactions (video and audio-taped conversation, classroom interaction), written narrative texts, or other.</span><br />

The cultural study of sport examines the ways in which institutionalized physical activity embodies and reflects social meanings and identities. The social practice of sport provides a space in which dominant discourses of race, gender, and social class are reproduced and resisted. As these physical activities become institutionalized, commercialized, and embedded within educational institutions themselves, individuals must navigate a nuanced and</span><span class="deschide"> often conflicted terrain in their respective participation and performance. This course, then, examines the role of sport in society broadly and the relationship of sport and education more specifically. The curriculum reviews the writing and research on sport and education from a sociological, psychological, and philosophical perspective, with a particular focus on the constructed divide of mind and body, as manifested in the institutional conflicts between school and sport.</span><br />

The course focuses on research on the education of prospective and practicing teachers, and on the institutional, organizational and policy contexts in which that research has been pursued. It is designed for students who are interested in doing research in this field or in becoming teacher educators, and is built on several organizing questions. What is the work (and workplace) for which teachers are being prepared? What is the occupational</span><span class="deschide"> conception of teaching that underpins practice, policy, and research? What is the significance of teacher education's fluctuating fortunes and shifting institutional forms? What is the field's capacity for research on teacher education? By comparison with research on teaching and learning, research on the education of teachers has been under-developed both conceptually and methodologically. Throughout the course, we will be judging the accomplishments and limitations of this field of practice and study, and locating opportunities for future research and development.</span><br />

This course introduces early-stage doctoral students to qualitative research so that they will be able to read qualitative studies critically, and learn to design and conduct qualitatively oriented studies themselves. Beginning with an overview of the epistemological assumptions behind different kinds of research, the course will explore various approaches and the kinds of topics and queries they support. Students will read and critique examples</span><span class="deschide"> of published research, partially chosen for the interests of course participants. Next, students will investigate topic development, the various methods of collecting and analyzing qualitative data, and report writing.<br/></span><br />

These interdisciplinary seminars address a series of questions. In what ways can philosophical, sociological, anthropological, historical, and psychological forms of inquiry be brought together to bear on the analysis of learning, on schooling, and on education more generally?

What is globalization? What are the implications of living in a &quot;global world&quot; for educational systems? In this course, we explore these questions by first examining various theoretical perspectives on globalization. We will then discuss several major developments associated with globalization that are affecting different levels of education (from primary to university) including the rise in accountability and testing, skills for</span><span class="deschide"> the &quot;knowledge&quot; economy, and immigration. We will consider the role of international organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations in shaping international policy and programs. We will also examine the role that the state, local communities, and non-governmental agencies play in providing and improving the quality of education. In the final part of the course, we examine topics including language policy, technology, and strategies to combat educational inequality. To explore these topics, we will read and discuss case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the United States to provide concrete examples of how global forces are changing the context and content of education internationally.</span><br />

Public school systems are organized not by best practice, but by historical evolution. In this course, we ask a simple question, &quot;What if we instead designed school systems with the needs of students furthest from opportunity?&quot; We begin by charting the existing landscape within complex school systems. Through our inquiry, we identify organizational factors that can be leveraged to reshape these existing systems to produce student outcomes that are in line</span><span class="deschide"> with students' full potential.</span><br />

Crisis is a fixed condition of contemporary organizational life (Roitman, 2014) and growing in<br/>
magnitude, frequency and complexity (Helsloot, Boin, Jacobs, &amp; Comfort, 2012). For public<br/>
system leaders in education and other public sectors anticipating crisis is not a question of if but<br/>
of when, what and how. As stewards of the public good, educational system leaders must be<br/>

During the fall semester, students complete 294A in which the preliminary Leadership Action Research Project is designed - a summative assessment for the Principal Leadership Institute and the MA program at Berkeley. Through the LARP process, students engage in a cycle of inquiry about a problem or concern that matters to their overall leadership agenda and creates more equitable spaces in urban schools. In this course, students</span><span class="deschide"> solidify the design of their LARP, take leadership action to implement their action plan, reflect on the action plan, revise the action plan - and make changes as appropriate - thus, engaging actively in the cycle of inquiry.</span><br />

Residencies are a central part of the LEEP curriculum.
