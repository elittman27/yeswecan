The course is designed primarily for those who are already familiar with programming in another language, such as python, and want to understand how R works, and for those who already know the basics of R programming and want to gain a more in-depth understanding of the language in order to improve their coding. The focus is on the underlying paradigms in R, such as functional programming, atomic vectors, complex data structures, environments</span><span class="deschide">, and object systems. The goal of this course is to better understand programming principles in general and to write better R code that capitalizes on the language's design.<br/></span><br />
