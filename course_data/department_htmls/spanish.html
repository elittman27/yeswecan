When Gabriel García Márquez published his monumental novel 100 Years of Solitude in 1967 he transformed not only the history of Latin American literature, but the history of literature and culture throughout the world. But then what happened? Beginning with Márquez’s novel, and what Cuban author Alejo Carpentier called “the marvelous real” (lo real maravilloso), this course in English will explore how Latin American fiction of the last fifty years has adapted, rejected</span><span class="deschide">, or otherwise reimagined magical realism to invent new ways to narrate and respond to the world’s changing realities. While our present world might seem more nightmarish than magical, the novels in this class will provide us with the resources to imagine reality otherwise.</span><br />

Taught in Spanish, Span 101 serves as an introduction to the Spanish sound system through an exploration of the complexities of native-like Spanish pronunciation and perceptions of native and non-native accent. Designed for both native and non-native speakers of Spanish as well as students without formal coursework in (Hispanic) Linguistics, this course centers on the acoustic nuances that distinguish standard Spanish pronunciation from non-standard</span><span class="deschide"> and non-native pronunciations. Emphasis will be placed on comparisons between the Spanish and English sound systems, and the acquisition of a native-like accent will be addressed from both theoretical and practical standpoints.</span><br />

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity. But what does it mean to convert? Is it a one-time event by which change gets effected and is final, or, does it involve multiple negotiations? Does the converter become curious</span><span class="deschide"> about and affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought? We will look at how this concept gets represented in different media and divergent forms of literacy: textual, pictorial, ritual.</span><br />

Spanish 123 will focus on the study of Nauatl Language &amp; Culture through a linguistic, literary, artistic, and historical approach. Living in Cholula, Puebla, constitutes a fundamental ingredient of this learning. Cholula and Puebla are Indeed places of intersection of two main components of Mexican civilization: pre-Hispanic and post-Hispanic. The study of Nauatl language –official language of the ancient Mexican-Aztec empire, and still spoken by 1.5 million</span><span class="deschide"> people today— will allow students to comprehend cultural, historic, and linguistic intersections between both civilizations. We will include social practices of the Mexican community and its interactions with Nauatl language and Nauatl speakers.</span><br />
