Over the last 25 years, psychologists have come to better understand the processes by which people make judgements and decisions.

This course proposes a guided tour through optimization models arising in practical finance. These problems include ones that are traditionally associated with optimization, including asset and liability management, asset pricing, and portfolio optimization. We also describe optimization models arising in model calibration, predication and estimation, and risk analysis.

Over the last 25 years, psychologists have come to better understand the processes by which people make judgements and decisions. They have identified common judgement and decision heuristics and the biases associated with these. An understanding of one's own decision biases and those of others is an important tool for managers. Behavioral Decision Theory has also contributed to our understanding of financial markets. This course will discuss the common biases and</span><span class="deschide"> heuristics.</span><br />

This course is an introduction to the legal rules which govern financial markets and institutions in general but also, specifically related to derivatives. The main purpose of legal rules and regulations is to ensure a smooth functioning of financial markets, as well as the safety and soundness of the overall financial system. We will examine the main areas of law and regulation, as they pertain to the centralized exchanges and the over the counter markets and the</span><span class="deschide"> role of regulatory arbitrage. We will specifically focus on Dodd-Frank and Basel III and how these rules came about as a response to the financial crisis. We will also explore the role of ethics in filling in the gaps that the law fails to fill.</span><br />
