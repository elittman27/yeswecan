A Berkeley Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences degree opens the door to many opportunities, but what exactly are they? Graduation is only a few years away and it's not too early to find out. In this seminar students will hear from practicing engineers who recently graduated. What are they working on? Are they working in a team? What do they wish they had learned better? How did they find their jobs?</span><br />

This course serves as an introduction to the principles of electrical engineering, starting from the basic concepts of voltage and current and circuit elements of resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Circuit analysis is taught using Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws with Thevenin and Norton equivalents. Operational amplifiers with feedback are introduced as basic building blocks for amplication and filtering. Semiconductor</span><span class="deschide"> devices including diodes and MOSFETS and their IV characteristics are covered. Applications of diodes for rectification, and design of MOSFETs in common source amplifiers are taught. Digital logic gates and design using CMOS as well as simple flip-flops are introduced. Speed and scaling issues for CMOS are considered. The course includes as motivating examples designs of high level applications including logic circuits, amplifiers, power supplies, and communication links.</span><br />

The objective of this course is to teach students majoring in these and related subjects how to use electronic devices to solve problems in their areas of expertise.<br />Through the lecture and laboratory, students gain insight into the possibilities and limitations of the technology and how to use electronics to help solve problems. Students learn to use electronics to interact with the environment through sound, light, temperature, motion using sensors and actuators, and how to use electronic computation to orchestrate the interactions and exchange information wirelessly over the internet.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Deploy electronic sensors and interface them to microcontrollers through digital and analog channels as well as common protocols (I2C, SPI),<br/>
Design, build and test electronic devices leveraging these concepts.<br/>
Interact with the internet and cloud services using protocols such as http, MQTT, Blynk,<br/>
Interface DC motors, steppers and servos to microcontrollers,<br/>
Represent information with voltage, current, power, and energy and how to measure these quantities with laboratory equipment,<br/>
To use and program low-cost and low-power microcontrollers for sensing, actuation, and information processing, and find and use program libraries supporting these tasks<br/>
Understand and make basic low-pass and high-pass filters, Wheatstone bridge etc.<br/>
Use electronics to sense and actuate physical parameters such as temperature, humidity, sound, light, and motion,</p></div>

This course covers the fundamental circuit and device concepts needed to understand analog integrated circuits. After an overview of the basic properties of semiconductors, the p-n junction and MOS capacitors are described and the MOSFET is modeled as a large-signal device. Two port small-signal amplifiers and their realization using single stage and multistage CMOS building blocks are discussed. Sinusoidal steady-state signals are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> and the techniques of phasor analysis are developed, including impedance and the magnitude and phase response of linear circuits. The frequency responses of single and multi-stage amplifiers are analyzed. Differential amplifiers are introduced.</span><br />

This course is the second in a two-semester series to equip students with the skills needed to analyze, design, and prototype power electronic converters. While EE 113/213A provides an overview of power electronics fundamentals and applications, EE 113B/213B<br/>
focuses on the practical design and hardware implementation of power converters. The primary focus of<br/>
EE 113B/213B is time in the laboratory, with sequential modules on topics such as power electronic</span><span class="deschide"> components,<br/>
PCB layout, closed-loop control, and experimental validation. At the end of the course, students will have<br/>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered</span><span class="deschide">, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br />

We will discuss the major classes of codes that are important in practice, including Reed Muller codes, cyclic codes, Reed Solomon codes, convolutional codes, concatenated codes, turbo</span><span class="deschide"> codes, and low density parity check codes. The relevant background material from finite field and polynomial algebra will be developed as part of the course. Overview of topics: binary linear block codes; Reed Muller codes; Galois fields; linear block codes over a finite field; cyclic codes; BCH and Reed Solomon codes; convolutional codes and trellis based decoding, message passing decoding algorithms; trellis based soft decision decoding of block codes; turbo codes; low density parity check codes.</span><br />

Biomedical imaging is a clinically important application of engineering, applied mathematics, physics, and medicine. In this course, we apply linear systems theory and basic physics to analyze X-ray imaging, computerized tomography, nuclear medicine, and MRI. We cover the basic physics and instrumentation that characterizes medical image as an ideal perfect-resolution image blurred by an impulse response.
