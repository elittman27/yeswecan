This seminar provides an overview of the intersection between global health and social justice, with a specific focus on the ways in which inequity, specifically the conditions that lead to poverty, disproportionately affect health outcomes. Students will learn about the historical and theoretical underpinnings of global health, how social determinants affect medical outcomes and health policy, the principles of international law and health</span><span class="deschide"> economics, and the structure of health delivery models. In the process, students will engage in topics related to social factors that impact health, including class, race, gender, and poverty. Class discussions will address contemporary global health priorities through the lens of human rights activism.</span><br />

Students now attending Berkeley will confront an extremely different set of challenges than the current faculty experienced. Economic growth cannot continue exponentially in a finite world. Human activity and human numbers threaten the possibility of irreversible damage to the fragile biosphere on which all life depends. In this 3-unit interdisciplinary course, students will focus on finding creative solutions to the problems faced by their</span><span class="deschide"> generation. Each week, experts will discuss problems and solutions concerning sustainability and climate change that they’re passionate about. Topics include energy consumption, food security, population growth and family planning, migration, climate change, policy, and governance.<br/></span><br />

In the past decade, health systems and their role in global health have received increasing focus. While disease-focused, 'vertical programs', such as malaria and HIV/AIDs still command the lion's share of donor resources, it has become clear that the sustainability of disease programs depends on embedding them into a country's health system. This course provides a real world, practical understanding of health systems, based on a solid academic</span><span class="deschide"> foundation. It introduces current debates about health systems, health financing, and universal health coverage in the international community.

This course provides an overview to ethical issues within a global health context. The course starts with an introduction to ethical frameworks, theories, and historical references that elevate the ethics conversation to the global stage. The course will then link theory to practice as we delve deeper into ethical issues in research, experiential learning, and delivery. We will consider ethical questions about the discipline of global public health</span><span class="deschide"> and the roles of governments, academic institutions, organizations, health professions, and members of the public as stewards of health.

This is an interdisciplinary course which will adopt a broad-based ecological perspective of health and behavior. This class will emphasize the interconnected and multidirectional relationships between biology, behavior, and the social environment. This course will be conducted as a seminar series (with a focus on biological processes). We will investigate the assertion that biological, psychological, and social processes interact over a lifetime</span><span class="deschide"> to influence health and vulnerability to disease (a developmental epigenetic perspective). Rather than focusing on &quot;if&quot; social factors can influence health and disease we will focus on &quot;how&quot; social factors may regulate/change biological measures. Three very general themes will be addressed: development, &quot;social&quot; neuroscience and gene-environment interactions as they relate to behavior. Topics such as constraints/plasticity and behavior, genetic determinism, vulnerability versus resilience, gene-environment interactions, fetal/developmental programming, and stress will all be touched upon.</span><br />

In this class, we will construct a framework to formulate explanations for health care disparities and to construct responses that have the potential for a policy-oriented, and therefore widespread, response. Taking advantage of selected developments in social science theory and research that can provide insight into how health care disparities come about, we will draw from anthropological and psychological theories of cultural orientation</span><span class="deschide">, cultural framing of problems, and cultural identity; as well as drawing from psychological theories of stress and coping. We also will draw from sociological theories of individual and community poverty, and theories characterizing health care system design and service delivery.</span><br />

PH 243A teaches students to construct efficient estimators &amp; obtain robust inference for parameters that utilize data-adaptive estimation strategies (i.e., machine learning). Students perform hands-on implementation of novel estimators using high-dimensional data structures, providing students with a toolbox for analyzing complex longitudinal, observational &amp; randomized control trial data. Students learn &amp; apply the core principles</span><span class="deschide"> of the Targeted Learning methodology, which generalizes machine learning to any estimand of interest; obtains an optimal estimator of the given estimand, grounded in theory; integrates state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning techniques; &amp; provides formal statistical inference in confidence intervals &amp; testing.</span><br />

With the ongoing “data explosion”, methods to delineate causation from correlation are perhaps more pressing now than ever. This course will introduce a general framework for Causal Inference in Public Health: 1) clear statement of the research question, 2) definition of the causal model and effect of interest, 3) assessment of identifiability, 4) choice and implementation of estimators including parametric and non-parametric methods, and 5) appropriate</span><span class="deschide"> interpretation of findings. The statistical methods include G-computation, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with machine learning.</span><br />

This doctoral seminar is designed to provide an understanding of the complex (and often interactive) individual and environmental conditions that increase the risk of psychopathology in individuals across the life span. We will start by learning about general concepts important to an understanding of psychopathology and prevention of psychopathology, including the &quot;biopsychosocial model,&quot; &quot;psychological resilence,&quot; and different</span><span class="deschide"> levels of preventive interventions. For each different area of psychopathology, we will consider: a) the core feature of disorder; b) key theory and empirical evidence regarding etiology and course, with a particular emphasis on understanding the range of risk and protective factors on the individual, family, and community level; and c) the implications of etiological understanding for public health efforts to prevent the particular disorder.</span><br />

This course is designed to review, evaluate, and apply methods currently used in the field of social epidemiology. The course aims to teach approaches to forming clear research questions, and selecting the best method(s) to answer the questions posed. Initially we will discuss approaches to defining clear and specific research questions. We will then discuss recent controversies around the meaning of questions posed in social epidemiology,</span><span class="deschide"> and the ability of currently used methods to answer questions in social epidemiology. Finally we will review, evaluate, and apply a range of different methods that are or could be used to answer questions in social epidemiology, again emphasizing the types of questions answered by these methods, and their ability to address the challenges to effectively answering questions in social epidemiology. There will be a mixture of discussion and lecture depending on the topic, with student participation and questions strongly encouraged.</span><br />

This course will be the principal immunology course for students in the field of public health. It is designed to teach both the basic biology of the human immune system and its response in health and disease, especially the specific response of the human immune system to major human pathogens. Four areas will be explored: 1) components of the immune system (spectrum of cell types and cell products); 2) different arms of the immune system including</span><span class="deschide"> humoral, cell-mediated, innate, and mucosal immunity; 3) specific immune response to infection caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens; and 4) disorders of the immune system unrelated to infectious disease. Through this course, students should not only gain a basic understanding of the human immune system, but also learn the functions and responses of the human immune system to diseases of infectious and non-infectious nature, and the relevance of these interactions in the context of public health problems.</span><br />

This course will cover public health, microbiological, social, and economical issues related to foodborne diseases. Three areas will be explored: 1) categories, clinical manifestations, and disease processes of foodborne illnesses; 2) etiological agents causing foodborne illnesses; 3) investigation and prevention of foodborne illness. The course will discuss different types of foodborne diseases, clinical manifestations, and the interactions</span><span class="deschide"> between etiological agents (pathogens and non-pathogens) and human hosts. We will cover pathogens that are the most frequently associated with foodborne illness including bacterial and viral pathogens such as Salmonella, E coli, hepatitis viruses and Norwalk-like gastroenteritus viruses. We will also study non-pathogen agents such as heavy metal, pesticide, and toxic chemicals. Futhermore, the course will discuss how to identify the etiological agents in outbreaks and possible measures that can be taken to minimize the risk to the public including vaccines and education. Finally, we will explore the social and economic issues involved in the food production, distribution, and consumption that contribute to foodborne diseases.</span><br />

Homelessness is an epidemic in the United States affecting more than 500,000 people each day. It impacts people of all races, age, and family situations, and it has enormous consequences for physical and mental health. There is no single cause, and no single solution. The focus of this course is the relationship between homelessness and health. We will discuss the range of causes for homelessness and how each of these is correlated to individual health, public health</span><span class="deschide">, public policy, and the law.

This course will focus on cutting-edge issues involving real-world toxicology in drug discovery, pesticide regulation, stem cell research, etc. Many well-known toxicologists, regulators, and consultants from pharmaceutical companies, petroleum industry, private consulting firms, non-profit institutes, federal and state regulatory agencies in the Bay Area will be invited to talk to our participating students. Some of the speakers are our school's</span><span class="deschide"> alumni who understand exactly what our students need to know before entering the real world. Learning outside the classroom will be another major focus and different from other existing toxicology courses offered at Berkeley. This new class will provide students a chance to visit some of the real-world sites allowing students to see and feel what they really need to know and to learn. To better prepare our students for the real world, we will use combined teaching/learning styles including lecture with discussion sections, site-visits, hand-on experience in a toxicology laboratory, and student group assignments or projects.</span><br />

Scientific knowledge and analyses are important to the development of public policies that address the impact of the environment on health. The limits of existing knowledge and uncertainties in research results create significant challenges in applying science to answer critical questions. This course critically examines how scientific information is used in policy decisions. Case studies of current issues address characterization of scientific</span><span class="deschide"> knowledge, interpretation of science in policy contexts, scientific integrity, and factors in addition to science that influence decisions. Assignments prepare students to effectively translate technical knowledge for multi-disciplinary and lay audiences and to participate in public policy proceedings.

Injuries are a major and often neglected health problem with substantial human and economic costs. Injuries are the leading cause of death from the first year of life to age 45, and the leading cause of lost potential years of life. This course provides an historical and conceptual framework within which to consider injuries (both intentional and unintentional) as social, and public health problems. Through review of epidemiology and intervention</span><span class="deschide"> studies, course work will consider the causes and consequences of traumatic injury within developmental, social and economic contexts.
