A science-based course on the most significant eruptions Earth has produced. Most eruptions discussed will be from within historic time and will involve information from geology (volcanology), geography, archaeology, history, art, and paleoenvironmental records such as tree-rings and ice-cores. After a two-class introduction to volcanoes, volcanic activity, and volcanology, and the hazards vs benefits of eruptions, each class will feature one of more eruptions of</span><span class="deschide"> different types from around the world. A science-based interpretation of the eruptions and effects on human-kind and the environment, will be presented.

This course provides a fundamental understanding of the extreme weather and climate variability that have affected Earth in recent decades. We begin with an overview of fire weather and hurricanes, using these phenomena to explore general principles that are also relevant to drought, tornadoes, and other extreme weather. Then we examine how atmospheric composition, planetary orbits, and radiation control global climate, and how all of these</span><span class="deschide"> influence extreme weather. Additional topics include prediction of complex systems, chaos theory, feedbacks, instability, atmospheric aerosols, and air pollution.

This course is a graduate course designed to introduce students in the earth sciences to the geology of earthquakes, including tectonic geomorphology, paleoseismology and the analysis and interpretation of geodetic measurements of active deformation. While the focus will be primarily on seismically active faults, we will also discuss deformation associated with landslides, regional isostatic rebound, and volcanoes, as well as measurements of global</span><span class="deschide"> plate motions. We will address methods and applications in paleoseismology, tectonic geomorphology, and geodesy. The course will address measurement techniques (e.g,. GPS, leveling, etc.), data analysis and inversion, and subsequent modeling and interpretation of the data. The integration of geodetic measurements with geologic and seismologic data allows an improved understanding of active processes.</span><br />
