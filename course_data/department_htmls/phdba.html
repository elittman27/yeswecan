This seminar features current research of faculty, from UC Berkeley and elsewhere, and of advanced doctoral students who are investigating the efficacy of economic and non-economic forms of organization. An interdisciplinary perspective--combining aspects of law, economics, and organization--is maintained. Markets, hierarchies, hybrids, bureaus, and the supporting institutions of law and politics all come under</span><span class="deschide"> scrutiny. The aspiration is to progressively build toward a new science of organization.</span><br />

This graduate course in political economy addresses the interactions among citizens, profit-maximizing firms and a vast class of non-market agents, such as governments, public administration and regulatory institutions. The class emphasizes the operative implications of non-market institutions in affecting and constraining firm strategy and individual behavior. Topics and cases cover economic and political institutions, economic policy, lobbying, clientelism, bureaucracy</span><span class="deschide">, regulation, antitrust, activism and the media. We corroborate the analytical framework with real-world applications, ranging from the US historical experience to cross-country comparisons, to develop insight in interpreting fundamental politico-economic constraints.</span><br />

The main focus of this course is on the economic institutions of capitalism. These institutions are studied in relation to the development of the state and the interplay of political and economic elites in the process that led to the Industrial Revolution. To properly conceptualize that process and get a long-run perspective, we use a comparative approach across regions of the world and over different historical periods.</span><br />
