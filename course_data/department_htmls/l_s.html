This course is designed for freshmen and sophomores who wish to know about entrepreneurship, its importance to our society, and its role in bringing new ideas to market.

How can you think about people in the entrepreneurial context? How can you garner support (financial and other) for an entrepreneurial venture? What do you do when nothing works as planned?

This course features significant engagement with arts, literature or language, either through critical study of works of art or through the creation of art.

An introduction to the historical circumstances and visual character of Western art from the Renaissance to the present. Not a chronological survey, but an exploration of topics and themes central to this period. For example: What tasks did painting and sculpture perform in the past? For whom, at whose expense? How do the rise of landscape painting, the cult of the artist, and the new emphasis on the nude relate to the emergence of modern</span><span class="deschide"> society? Do stylistic labels like Classicism, Realism, Impressionism, and Modernism help us answer such questions?

Every day we make decisions that can and should be informed by science. We make decisions as individuals, as voters, and as members of our various communities. The problem is, we don’t do it so well—a fact sadly apparent in political debates. This course aims to equip students with basic tools to be better thinkers. We will explore key aspects of scientific thinking that everyone should know, especially the many ways that we humans tend to</span><span class="deschide"> fool ourselves, and how to avoid them—including how to differentiate signal from noise, evaluate causal claims, and avoid reasoning biases. We’ll then look at the best models for using science to guide decisions, combining both evidence and values, with the ultimate goal of bettering the world.</span><br/>

Today the humanities, once considered the jewels of a liberal arts education, find they must justify their very existence. In 1967, Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California, argued against taxpayers &quot;subsidizing intellectual curiosity.&quot; By 2015, the Wisconsin governor had reduced his university's mission to &quot;meeting the state's workforce needs.&quot; Is this self-styled &quot;commonsensical&quot; thinking valid? Should the humanities try</span><span class="deschide"> to make themselves more professional or &quot;scientific&quot;? Rather than seeing the humanities as a series of independent disciplines focused on different specific ends, this course argues that the humanities map the many ways that human beings have sought to be human throughout human history.</span><br/>

This is a Discovery Course for non-Biology majors designed to introduce lower-division college students to biology through the lens of the contemporary problems facing people, the planet and the species of the planet. Modern genetic contributions will be presented on such issues as genetic engineering of plants and animals, the emergence of new pathogens, the role of genetic variation among individuals, and the extent to which DNA is and</span><span class="deschide"> isn’t destiny. Each week will close with the presentation and discussion of a defining biological challenge facing the world.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> The learning objectives will be, at one end, to understand what an experiment is, how is it controlled and what does one need to know about an experiment to be able to rely upon any conclusion. That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

Bioinspired design views the process of how we learn from Nature as an innovation strategy translating principles of function, performance and aesthetics from biology to human technology. The creative design process is driven by interdisciplinary exchange among engineering, biology, art, architecture and business. Diverse teams of students will collaborate on, create, and present original bioinspired design projects. Lectures discuss biomimicry</span><span class="deschide">, challenges of extracting principles from Nature, scaling, robustness, and entrepreneurship through case studies highlighting robots that run, fly, and swim, materials like gecko-inspired adhesives, artificial muscles, medical prosthetic devices, and translation to start-ups.</span><br/>

We will examine the historical and geographical development of the motion picture industry from the rise of the studio system to the &quot;new&quot; entertainment economy of the 1980's, as we think about the way films have constructed powerful and productive fantasies about the boundaries between public and private, work and play</span><span class="deschide">, commerce and art, fantasy and reality. Our topics will include the history of labor in the culture industry, the implications of shifts in the spatial organization of film production, and the effects of Hollywood on the larger politics of southern California.</span><br/>

Each lower-division course in this series deals primarily with the human events, institutions and activities of the past. Historical Studies are particularly important because, to paraphrase the philosopher George Santayana, those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat its mistakes. The study of history provides us with perspective on the human condition and with an appreciation of the origins and evolution of the numerous cultures</span><span class="deschide"> and social orders that have populated the earth. Whether students study history to understand how our world evolved from the past or to focus on the distinctions between the present and previous eras, they will come away with a richer understanding of and appreciation for human experience.</span><br/>

The word “Disney” refers to a man who died in 1966, a film studio that became a global media corporation, six amusement parks/resorts, an oeuvre of audio-visual texts with hundreds of characters and millions of associated products, and a theory of space and landscape design.

How do we know what the “moral” of a story is? We will focus on three biblical narratives that have frequently been interpreted as teaching moral lessons: the story of Job, the story of Abraham and the binding of Isaac, and the story of Moses giving the law. These stories have been interpreted variously in moral terms--e.g. as demonstrating the virtues of faith, obedience, mercy, and forgiveness, and as teaching us about guilt, punishment, reward, and</span><span class="deschide"> human frailty. They have also been analyzed as existential parables, psychological dramas, and political allegories. The goal of this class is to examine how a range of different, and often provocative, interpretations of these stories’ moral lessons rest on particular ways of reading.</span><br/>

What is everyone talking about when they talk politics? Do you wish you had an entry point into the conversation? Or a guide to its ABC’s? Do you wonder why everyone else seems to have such strong opinions? Or why your own opinions seem too strong–or not strong enough to go anywhere?

In this class we will consider big words in law that are key to our present, understood as plural and global. Each semester, the course will focus on twelve timely words that demand our attention and critical reflection. We will choose words that are often mobilized in political battles, approaching them not as fixed units of speech but as sites for arguments and visions for the planet we co-inhabit. The objective is not to secure a definition for the word; it is</span><span class="deschide"> rather to open it up and to gain appreciation for its different layers, operations, and sometimes unrealized meanings. Because law and legal words are themselves contested, we will also consider the differing commitments that people display toward what counts as law for them.</span><br/>

What is the purpose of education? Should the university prepare students for the job market or emphasize the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake? Is knowledge a value in itself? This course explores these questions, among others, while concentrating on the German idea of Bildung. It introduces students to the classical idea of education and self-formation by reading a wide range of texts from German philosophy, intellectual history, and literature.</span><span class="deschide"> Furthermore, the course traces the history of this idea by exploring how Bildung informs contemporary literary works and film. Emphasis will be on issues of class, race, and gender.</span><br/>

This course explores the concepts of origins in science and religion and their cultural contexts and entanglements, from antiquity to the present. Guiding questions include these: What are origins, and why do we want to know about them? How does this desire manifest itself in different ways of constructing and analyzing knowledge? What sorts of intellectual processes, standards, and tests can be applied to different concepts of origins? What</span><span class="deschide"> happens when different notions of origins clash?</span><br/>

Augustine said, famously, that he always thought he understood what time was until he started thinking about it. That was when he realized he had no idea. This course will address various aspects of the nature of time, including the way we experience it, the way it organizes our everday world, and the way it stands if it does at the foundation of the physical universe. The course will be devoted both to understanding, and to understanding</span><span class="deschide"> the relations among, these three aspects of temporality.</span><br/>

Twenty-five years ago the Dalai Lama suggested that a dialogue between Buddhist practitioners and Western scientists interested in the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the world might lead to new ideas and be of benefit to both communities. While science and religion are not generally considered to be natural collaborators, the dialogue that ensued quickly gained momentum and catalyzed new strands of research, most notably</span><span class="deschide"> in the area of the neuroscience of meditation and emotion. We will continue this dialogue, first by laying the necessary groundwork in our respective fields, and then by exploring areas of convergence and divergence around certain themes.</span><br/>

What is a crowd? Is it a swarm of bodies on the street, a dancing flash mob, or a set of data points culled from social media? This class investigates how digital cloud technologies cluster us together into formations that could be understood as both pleasurable and dangerous. We will look at how visual artists and social theorists have addressed issues such as self-tracking, fears around immigration, and crowdsourcing. We will also investigate how surveillance, big</span><span class="deschide"> data, and social media are used by current governments and reframed by insurgent political movements. We approach the topic through historically grounded, interdisciplinary scholarship in the visual arts, art history, ethnography, literature, and geography.<br/></span><br/>

This course explores the intersections between aesthetic practice and social change. Students will investigate—in both theory and practice—the capacity of art making to cultivate transformation of themselves, their relationships, their practices, their institutions, and the larger economic and socio-political structures in which they function, locally and globally. Focusing on historical and contemporary artists and political issues, we ask:</span><span class="deschide"> 1) How is art impacted by social change? 2) How has art been used toward social change? and 3) How can we, as course participants, use art to bring about social change?</span><br/>

Each ethical decision we make (or avoid) co-creates who we are, our lives, our relationships, and the world we live in. Readings from Aristotle through the existentialists, an exploration of comparative religion, studies in intra- and inter-personal psychology, and cases from literature to business will orient and inspire and support students’ quests to find and live their deepest values. We will investigate those characteristics and habits</span><span class="deschide"> of human nature that hinder affirmative ethical behavior (and the realization of maximum human potential generally), and explore characteristics and practices that can foster each student’s inherent imagination, creative capacity, integration, and fully satisfying participation in his or her life.</span><br/>

This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to an understanding of happiness. The first part of the course will be devoted to the different treatments of happiness in the world's philosophical traditions, focusing up close on conceptions or the good life in classical Greek and Judeo-Christian thought, the great traditions in East Asian thought (Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism), and ideas about happiness that emerged more recently in</span><span class="deschide"> the age of Enlightenment. With these different perspectives as a framework, the course will then turn to treatments of happiness in the behavioral sciences, evolutionary scholarship, and neuroscience. Special emphasis will be given to understanding how happiness arises in experiences of the moral emotions, including gratitude, compassion, reverence and awe, as well as aesthetic emotions like humor and beauty.</span><br/>

&quot;Sticks and stones/ Can break my bones/ But words will never hurt me&quot;—but is that really so? People do things with words and in turn words do things to people. Language can inform or deceive, seduce or insult, make us fall in love or kill our reputation. What is it about language that gives it that power? How can sounds in a conversation, signs on a page make us laugh or cry? What does it take to speak and be not only heard but actually responded</span><span class="deschide"> to? How do our words remember, imagine, anticipate, respond to the words of others? And how can we acquire conversational power?

Gender, sex, and power shape and influence our cultural and social world in obvious and in hidden ways. Bay Area artists and activists focus on illuminating, shifting, redefining, and making use of the juncture of gender, sex, and power to bring about new opportunities and new futures. We will first explore the terrain of academic definitions of gender, sex, power and the connections among them, emphasizing how gender/sex/power</span><span class="deschide"> is interlinked with racism, classism, colonialism, and dis/ablism.

Berkeley Changemaker impact occurs across many fronts: scientific, artistic, social, and entrepreneurial. This course helps students identify as a Berkeley Changemaker and learn the critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills to become one. Combining disciplines across UC Berkeley, the course also helps launch the Berkeley Discovery arc. Students develop their own leadership styles and discover how they</span><span class="deschide"> can create and lead diverse teams to act upon the world. Values in Berkeley’s DNA like Questioning the Status Quo and going Beyond Yourself support students in leading from whatever position they occupy, preparing them to leave their mark on campus, in their communities, or beyond.
