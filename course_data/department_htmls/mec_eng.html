Phenomena of physical, technological, and biological significance in flows of gases and liquids at the microscale. The course begins with familiar equations of Newtonian fluid mechanics, then proceeds to the study of essentially 1-D flows in confined geometries with the lubrication equations. Next is a study of the flow of thin films spreading under gravity or surface tension gradients. Lubrication theory of compressible gases leads to consideration</span><span class="deschide"> of air bearings. Two- and 3-D flows are treated with Stokes' equations. Less familiar physical phenomena of significance and utility at the microscale are then considered: intermolecular forces in liquids, slip, diffusion and bubbles as active agents. A review of relevant aspects of electricity and magnetism precedes a study of electrowetting and electrokinetically driven liquid flows.</span><br />

•<br/>
Make students aware of current capabilities and innovations in sub-micrometer lithography and in the handling of nanoscale materials;<br/>
•<br/>
Equip students to select an appropriate lithography or processing technique for a given application from among multiple alternatives;<br/>
•<br/>
Provide students with an understanding of the transformations of material that occur in sub-micrometer lithography techniques, such that they can understand why certain processing routes might be preferable to others for particular applications.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> •<br/>
Articulate the key requirements (i.e. resolution, maximum defect density, and multi-layer alignment precision) of micro- and nano-patterning processes to be used in a range of applications, such as semiconductors, hard disk-drives, large-area photovoltaics, and biomedical microdevices.<br/>
•<br/>
Identify which of a set of available micro-/nano-patterning processes (e.g. extreme-UV lithography, directed self-assembly, multiple e-beam lithography, and imprint lithography) are suitable for a given patterning application.<br/>
•<br/>
Accurately explain and distinguish between the physical transformations of material that occur in a number of sub-micrometer patterning processes, including imprint lithography, micro-contact printing, micro-embossing, and micro-gravure.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Identify a number of currently open research questions relating to nanoscale processing of materials and suggest possible creative solutions to them.<br/>
•<br/>
Use numerical simulation techniques to model the behavior of one or more lithographic techniques, including nanoimprint, photolithography, or electron-beam lithography. Use insights from modeling to optimize key process parameters and to make trade-offs in the geometrical design of a pattern that is to be fabricated.</p></div>

This course explores contemporary research in engineering design and prototyping, as well as related cognitive issues in engineering curricular development, pedagogy, and assessment. One recurring theme throughout the course will be the duality between learning and design: design-based research, design as a pedagogy for integrative learning and the role of cognition and the learning sciences in the practice of engineering design. It has been motivated by several</span><span class="deschide"> reforms: (1) National efforts to better train and educate engineers for the engineering workplace in the 21st Century: to better prepare engineers to face multidisciplinary problems and product design in competitive industries and improve their skills in teamwork and communication.</span><br />

This course presents the fundamentals of electromagnetic interactions in deformable continuous media. It develops the background necessary to understand various modern technologies involving MEMS devices, sensors and actuators, plasmas, and a wide range of additional phenomena. The emphasis of this course is on fundamentals, beginning with Maxwell's equations in vacuum, the ether relations and their extension to electromagnetic interactions</span><span class="deschide"> in materials. The treatment is general within the limits of nonrelativistic physics and accommodates coupling with mechanical and thermal effects. The topics discussed are all developed at a general level including the effects of finite deformations. Various linear models, which are especially useful in applications, are developed through specialization of general theory. This course will be of interest to students in engineering, physics, and applied mathematics.</span><br />

Sustainable design, manufacturing, and management as exercised by the enterprise is a poorly understood idea and one that is not intuitively connected to business value or engineering practice. This is especially true for the manufacturing aspects of most enterprises (tools, processes, and systems). This course will provide the basis for understanding (1) what comprises sustainable practices in for-profit enterprises, (2) how to practice</span><span class="deschide"> and measure continuous improvement using sustainability thinking, techniques, and tools for product and manufacturing process design, and (3) the techniques for and value of effective communication of sustainablilty performance to internal and external audiences.
