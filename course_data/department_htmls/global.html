This course offers an introduction to ways of thinking about, and visualizing, “the global” over time. People from different societies and cultures have been drawn together as a result of processes that can best be conceived of as “flows” of people, capital, ideas and goods. Using a panoramic lens, we will explore a series of interactions, analyzing the wide-ranging effects of those interactions and the artifacts they produced. By studying</span><span class="deschide"> a variety of encounters, we will cultivate a broader sense of how the “global” has been defined and experienced through the lens of cultural interaction. Globalization itself is not a new phenomenon; it can be traced back centuries if not millennia.</span><br/>

There are environmental implications to how we pursue development. There are debates, emerging from unequal distribution of environmental impacts and unequal distribution of wealth, about how to respond to environmental crises. In this course, we will look at the history of economic development, the emergence of environmental awareness and the history of the politics of the environment. We will look at contemporary debates over our economic model</span><span class="deschide">, energy, agricultural production, and rural and urban development. Finally, we will analyze the types of public policies being implemented to address environmental concerns, as well as their impacts.

International migration has been growing rapidly. In this course, we will examine global migration patterns and factors that drive migration - from violence to lack of economic opportunity to environmental conditions. We will also examine conditions in receiving countries that generate demand for immigrant labor, and transnational social networks that help facilitate migration. Immigration has transformed receiving countries into multicultural societies, straining</span><span class="deschide"> traditional notions of national identity, and increasingly producing a nativist backlash. We will examine recent immigration policy and explore laws, policies and agreements with regard to migration, how migration impacts economic development, and human trafficking.</span><br/>

&quot;Recent World History Through Film&quot; examines the recent history of the world through the lens of popular, critically-acclaimed, and international films. Some of the films’ makers purport to be telling the “truth” about world history, while others base the films only loosely on historical facts or circumstances. Course objectives are to develop a deeper understanding of recent world history by engaging with and analyzing a range of films. Prior knowledge</span><span class="deschide"> of world history is not required. What is required is to be open-minded yet critical and to view these films as an avenue for finding out more about events, places, and global historical phenomena.</span><br/>

This course studies Muslim-Jewish relations as they developed in the Middle East and North Africa from the rise of Islam to the present day. It analyzes how ethnic and religious boundaries were both drawn and transgressed in historical settings including Arabia in the time of Muhammad, Islamic Spain, the Ottoman Empire, and modern Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, and Israel. It asks how this shared cultural heritage is remembered and mobilized in the</span><span class="deschide"> contemporary world, shedding light on the current state of Muslim-Jewish relations not only in the MENA but in Europe and the US as well. Films, memoirs, scripture, and historical works form the basis of our inquiry.</span><br/>

Students will also probe shifting narratives of wartime responsibilities in the post-war Japanese and Korean societies. Students will engage in issues of reparations, legal accountability, historical memories, truth</span><span class="deschide"> and justice, apology and forgiveness, and reconciliation both at the personal and structural levels, by directly interacting with the conflict parties who represent such diverse positions.

This course will describe the issues, policies and practices of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. Terrorism continues to increase in frequency and lethality. Insurgency too is more frequent and deadly (insurgency now is riskier than terrorism). The actors and methods increasingly overlap, so that terrorism and insurgency practically must be studied together. This course examines the concepts, history, motivations and methods of terrorism and insurgency, and</span><span class="deschide"> ways in which the counter-terrorist and counter-insurgent side counter those motivations and methods, navigating the legal and ethical bounds.</span><br/>
