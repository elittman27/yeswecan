This Freshman-level Introductory course will provide an intuitive overview of the fundamental problems addressed and methods in the fields of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research including Constrained Optimization, Human Factors, Data Analytics, Queues and Chains, and Linear Programming. The course will focus on two-dimensional, i.e., bivariate, examples where the problems and methods are amenable to visualization and geometric intuition. The course will discuss</span><span class="deschide"> applications such as dieting, scheduling, and transportation. This course will not require pre-requisites and will present the core concepts in a self-contained manner that is accessible to Freshmen to provide the foundation for future coursework.</span><br />

Provide a broad survey of the important topics in IE and OR, and develop intuition about problems, algorithms, and abstractions using bivariate examples (2D).<br/>
•<br/>
Describe different mathematical abstractions used in IEOR (e.g., graphs, queues, Markov chains), and how to use these abstractions to model real-world problems.<br/>
•<br/>
Introduce students to the data analysis process including: developing a hypothesis, acquiring data, processing the data, testing the hypothesis, and presenting results.<br/>

This highly-applied course surveys a variety of key of concepts and tools that are useful for designing and building applications that process data signals of information. The course introduces modern open source, computer programming tools, libraries, and code samples that can be used to implement data applications. The mathematical concepts highlighted in this course include filtering, prediction, classification, decision-making, Markov chains</span><span class="deschide">, LTI systems, spectral analysis, and frameworks for learning from data. Each math concept is linked to implementation using Python using libraries for math array functions (NumPy), manipulation of tables (Pandas), long term storage (SQL, JSON, CSV files), natural language (NLTK), and ML frameworks.</span><br />

To expose students to a variety of statistical learning methods, all of which are relevant in useful in wide range of disciplines and applications.<br />2.<br/>
To carefully present the statistical and computational assumptions, trade-offs, and intuition underlying each method discussed so that students will be trained to determine which techniques are most appropriate for a given problem.<br />3.<br/>
Through a series of real-world examples, students will learn to identify opportunities to leverage the capabilities of data analytics and will see how data analytics can provide a competitive edge for companies.<br />4.<br/>
To train students in how to actually apply each method that is discussed in class, through a series of labs and programming exercises.<br />5.<br/>
For students to gain some project-based practical data science experience, which involves identifying a relevant problem to be solved or question to be answered, gathering and cleaning data, and applying analytical techniques.<br />6.<br/>
To introduce students to advanced topics that are important to the successful application of machine learning methods in practice, include how methods for prediction are integrated with optimization models and modern optimization techniques for large-scale learning problems.</p></div>

Introductory course on design, programming, and statistical analysis of simulation methods and tools for enterprise-scale systems such as traffic and computer networks, health-care and financial systems, and factories. Topics include the types of problems that can be solved by such methods. Programming material includes the theory behind random variable generation for a variety of common variables. Advanced techniques such as variance reduction</span><span class="deschide">, simulation optimization, or meta-modeling are considered. Student teams implement an enterprise-scale simulation in a semester-length design project.</span><br />

This course will cover topics related to the interplay between optimization and statistical learning. The first part of the course will cover statistical modeling procedures that can be defined as the minimizer of a suitable optimization problem. The second part of the course will discuss the formulation and numerical implementation of learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC), which is a method for robust adaptive optimization that can</span><span class="deschide"> use machine learning to provide the adaptation. The last part of the course will deal with inverse decision-making problems, which are problems where an agent's decisions are observed and used to infer properties about the agent.</span><br />
