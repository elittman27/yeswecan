This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are</span><span class="deschide"> introduced using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br />

Supply chain analysis is the study of quantitative models that characterize various economic trade-offs in the supply chain. The field has made significant strides on both theoretical and practical fronts. On the theoretical front, supply chain analysis inspires new research ventures that blend operations research, game theory, and microeconomics. These ventures result in an unprecedented amalgamation of prescriptive, descriptive</span><span class="deschide">, and predictive models characteristic of each subfield.

An introduction to the fundamentals of sensor usage and signal processing, and their application to civil systems. In particular, the course focuses on how basic classes of sensors work, and how to go about choosing the best of the new MEMS-based devices for an application. The interpretation of the data focuses on analysis of transient signals, an area typically ignored in traditional signal processing courses. Goals include development of a critical</span><span class="deschide"> understanding of the assumptions used in common sensing and analysis methods and their implications, strengths, and limitations.</span><br />
