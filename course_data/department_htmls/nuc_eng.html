Biomedical imaging is a clinically important application of engineering, applied mathematics, physics, and medicine. In this course, we apply linear systems theory and basic physics to analyze X-ray imaging, computerized tomography, nuclear medicine, and MRI. We cover the basic physics and instrumentation that characterizes medical image as an ideal perfect-resolution image blurred by an impulse response. This material could prepare the student</span><span class="deschide"> for a career in designing new medical imaging systems that reliably detect small tumors or infarcts.</span><br />

The project should give students strong foundation to tackle more advanced risk models or dynamic cancer models. <br />They will be exposed to the multi-scale complexity of the tissue response to ionizing radiation from the whole organism to individual cells and down to the DNA. Molecular biology describing the cellular response and the DNA repair mechanisms will be covered, with an emphasis on cell kinetics such as recovery processes and cell cycle sensitivity. The overall tissue response will also be discussed with an effort to distinguish acute and delayed effects. Radiation risk models and their impact on limits will be introduced and described in the context of past and current research.<br />This course is designed for Nuclear Engineering students and in particular those pursuing a Medical Physics Certificate with knowledge essential to radiobiology.
