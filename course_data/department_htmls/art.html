Water is one of the most precarious resources in California, yet many people believe the water supply to be unlimited. The arts and visual cultures contribute to such popular misconceptions of natural resources, but media art can also help people develop more accurate and relevant conceptions of natural resources. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary creative research and media art production with the end goal of advancing popular conceptions about</span><span class="deschide"> water. Students study water cultures in California from the 1750's onwards and experience a wide range of watercourses and waterworks to inspire new art.

Taught by faculty from the Departments of Art Practice, Geography, and History of Art, this Big Ideas course is a space where we collectively study, think, and make art about the cataclysmic ecological crises that threaten our planet today.

This studio course investigates representations of the human body across different periods and locations to explore what it means to depict the body in the 21st Century. How do dominant signifiers and various intersections of race, gender, class, religion, sexuality, and disability influence the rendering and image reception of human bodies? The studio component of the course will work from live models as well as creating</span><span class="deschide"> full body self-portraits that challenge the parameters of the canon and conventional expectations. We will explore drawing across all mediums through art history lectures, student-led discussions, in-class prompts, field trips, and visiting artists.<br/>

Regardless of the media used, the objective of this class is to question issues of space, placement, presentation, and context regarding one’s work. Students will consider notions of site specificity and of whether an object is distinct from its environment or is part of it. Other concerns include the architectural and historical information a space possesses, how to activate a space with your ideas, how your work can have a dialog with a</span><span class="deschide"> space and where/how you can display and document your work. Students will explore topics through site-based projects, lectures, readings, critique, and field trips.<br/>

This course trains students in new strategies in contemporary creative research in the beautiful, ecologically diverse and yet precarious island of Mo’orea in French Polynesia. At Richard B. Gump Station, students will engage in creative research with two faculty members during the course of one month. Students study traditional Polynesian art forms through intensive workshops with</span><span class="deschide"> local artisans at the Atitia Center and create two art projects with local tools and materials in the first two weeks of the course. In the second two weeks, students explore socio-ecological processes in reefs, shores, communities and mountains through visual narratives, including sound recording, video recording, data sonification, editing and dissemination.<br/></span><br />
