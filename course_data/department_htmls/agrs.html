This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius, and Lucian). as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between</span><span class="deschide"> magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.</span><br/>

Some of the most recognizable images from ancient Greek and Roman literature are the warriors who stride across battlefields in a blaze of glory. But these heroic images tell only a small part of the story. Warfare influenced almost every aspect of life in these cultures, and not just for those who fought on the battlefield or for political leaders. In this class we will read a variety of literary works that illuminate the experience of warfare and its aftermath</span><span class="deschide"> in ancient Greece and Rome – texts depicting the battlefield, but also the stories of veterans, women at home and in war, enslaved captives and others. While we will focus primarily on literary representations of these experiences, these readings will be placed in broader historical</span><br/>

War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements.

Classical literature is full of mythological plots involving gods and monsters, heroes and kings.

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

In this course, we will look at ancient Greek ideas and practices concerning the nature, sources, psychological effects, and social functions of music (including singing, instrumental music, and dance), during the Archaic and Classical periods (ca. 800-350 BCE). Taking an ethnomusicological approach, we will examine Greek musical culture as a whole, focusing especially on differences of gender, ethnicity, regionalism, class/status (e.g., free vs. slave), and even</span><span class="deschide"> species – since the Greeks recognized that some animals are very musical, as of course are several of the gods and goddesses – to see what different kinds of music were played by the various performers, and at what kinds of occasions. No knowledge of Greek or Latin required.</span><br/>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions.We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius and Lucian) as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between magic</span><span class="deschide">, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world. In this course we will first spend some time learning about the historical condition of slavery in these two societies, then read a variety of works that show some of the ways that slaves and slavery operated in the intellectual and imaginative life of ancient authors. The three genres we will</span><span class="deschide"> focus on are philosophy, drama (both tragedy and comedy) and the novel.

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary,</span><span class="deschide"> and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve.

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>

Augustus, the first emperor of Rome, inaugurated an enormous building program during<br/>
his long reign that completely transformed the empire’s capital city. In this seminar we<br/>
will consider some of the most famous of his constructions—his Mausoleum (the tumulus<br/>
of the Julii), the temple of Palatine Apollo, the Ara Pacis Augustae (Altar of the<br/>
Augustan Peace), the Augustan Forum—and we will examine the ways in which these<br/>
new monuments helped shape</span><span class="deschide"> popular perceptions of the new system of government that<br/>
Augustus established (—a veiled monarchy).</span><br/>
