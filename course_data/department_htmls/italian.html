This course is a brief introduction to the history of Italian cinema. No prior knowledge of Italian cinema or film theory is necessary. We will study major auteurs and genres of Italian cinema in the context of Italian culture and history from 1895 to the present. The course is structured chronologically: we will begin with silent cinema, work our way through the 20th century, and end with contemporary cinema. All students must attend weekly screenings. Films and</span><span class="deschide"> film clips will also be shown during lectures.</span><br />
