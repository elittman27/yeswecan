This course will teach anyone how to start to be a designer, not just of drawings and objects, but also buildings, landscapes, and urban spaces. And not just in isolation, but in the complex web of ecological and man-made systems which makes up our shifting environment. You will take from the course first-hand experience of drawing, measuring, and design — which form the basis of the professions of architecture, landscape architecture</span><span class="deschide">, and urban planning— and which culminate in a final design project in the course. The course is open to all undergraduate students.</span><br />

Institute participants explore the methods and theories of the environmental design disciplines, experience the culture of design and planning studios, connect to faculty and practitioners</span><span class="deschide">, and build a portfolio for graduate school application. Each program includes a lecture series, a design or planning studio, a media seminar, and site visits.

This study of cities is more important than ever; for the first time in history more people live in urban than rural areas, and cities will account for all of the world's population growth for at least the next half-century.

This course explores cities and landscapes as layered repositories of history, both ecological and human. Examining environmental design history and practice, it highlights how deep time legacies are acknowledged or ignored in placemaking, including racialized spatial histories. In addressing the role of architecture, city planning, and landscape design in shaping places and giving them meaning, the course explores the diversity of spatially</span><span class="deschide"> defined experiences and the ways in which they are shaped by policy and professional practice. Case studies on Bay Area urban and social geography are linked with transnational histories and design movements to highlight the larger forces that have shaped the local historical and social landscape.</span><br />

What is the social art of architecture in America? What was it historically, where is it now, where is it going--and why should you care? In this course, we will explore contemporary and historic attempts to confront social needs through themes: Design by Professionals (Architects, City Planners, Urban Designers, Sociologists, Philosophers, Philanthropists), and Design by Laypeople (Squatters, Intentional Communities, Do It Yourself). The</span><span class="deschide"> objective is to discharge the false dualism that has emerged in architecture between social concerns and creative design.</span><br />

This course focuses on four inter-connected areas of pedagogy important to urban planning, design, and public policy that repair, rather than perpetuate, systemic harm. First, we will examine the main tenets of critical race theory to address the structural roots and history of injustice. Second, students will learn the theory, methodology and practice of transformative community planning, design and public policy principles that center the lived experiences, experiential</span><span class="deschide"> knowledge, and agency of people directly impacted by systemic injustice. Third, we will examine the role of individual and collective healing focusing on the principles of restorative justice. Fourth, we will explore the theory and practice of love-based justice.<br/></span><br />

This Clinic seeks to develop students to advance an anti-racist future guided by the principles of love, healing, and justice. Students are required to enroll in the companion theory course, EnvDes C231, Critical Race Theory in Planning, Design, and Public Policy. This Clinic focuses on four areas of professional practice. First, students are supervised by experienced professional practitioners. Second, students will learn the framework of racial equity</span><span class="deschide"> analysis through applied theoretical frameworks and case study pedagogy. Third, students will apply the framework of racial equity analysis to real-world projects.
