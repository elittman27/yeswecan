An introduction to the art of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the European Middle Ages. Painting, sculpture, and architecture are presented chronologically and considered in relation to their historical and cultural circumstances. The course aims to provide students with a basic knowledge of how artworks balance past tradition with innovation; how people actually looked at artworks and what they valued in them; how works of art were commissioned and</span><span class="deschide"> displayed; how artists went about their work; and how genre and medium affected an artwork's appearance. The question of artistic quality will be central to the course. In the process, the student will acquire a critical vocabulary for thinking and writing about art. Recommended both for potential majors and for students with a general interest in the topic.</span><br />

This course is an introduction to the visual arts of Europe and the USA from the 14th century to the present day. This course will attempt to situate works of art into long, general trends in art practice of the Western tradition, though it will prioritize sustained focus on single case-studies which punctuate the five centuries of art for which this course offers a historical account; attention will also gather around particular representative</span><span class="deschide"> artists’ careers. We’ll explore how the fine arts can be considered as part of wider visual culture(s) in the Western tradition, and the ways art within such a broad tradition can function both as a stabilizing and as a transformative force within social/political/religious/racial/etc contexts.</span><br />

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br />

It introduces the study of art not simply in terms of artists, periods, content, and style, but in relation to acts of looting/theft, iconoclasm/vandalism, and forgery—behaviors that seem contradictory to the importance of art in human culture. Global in its range, the course addresses</span><span class="deschide"> important episodes of taking, breaking, and faking from the ancient world to the present.

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present</span><span class="deschide"> will provide an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br />

Proceeding in a chronological order, we will engage with key moments of artistic production in the region. We will locate art and architecture within the larger world of political economies, religion and philosophy, gender and sexuality, urbanity, and state formations to generate the depth and context required for</span><span class="deschide"> understanding South and Southeast Asia through a historical frame. Thus, we will study Buddhism and Hinduism in the early Common Era, early modern Islamic art, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism.

This course is an introduction to the art and architecture of modern South, Southeast, and East Asia. Using a comparative perspective, each week will focus on a set of case studies—the work of particular artists and art movements or the architecture of specific Asian cities—to reconstruct an expansive history of modern art and architecture in Asia from 1800 to the present. Class lectures will be completed by a close examination of modern Asian art collections</span><span class="deschide"> on campus and in the Bay Area. We will also engage with numerous diasporic Asian artists who live and work in the area.<br/></span><br />

Social and economic organization, religious and political thought, were reconfigured into forms we recognize today.

In aesthetic terms, it took on properties which defined the modern.</span><span class="deschide"> Italy and the Netherlands each contributed to the revolution in pictorial expression.

Taught by faculty from the Departments of Art Practice, Geography, and History of Art, this Big Ideas course is a space where we collectively study, think, and make art about the cataclysmic ecological crises that threaten our planet today.

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity. But what does it mean to convert? Is it a one-time event by which change gets effected and is final, or, does it involve multiple negotiations? Does the converter become curious</span><span class="deschide"> about and affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought?

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits—bronze and marble statues set up in public places—and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. We will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative</span><span class="deschide"> traditions, visual and literary, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences this has for historians.</span><br />

Our subject encompasses multiple genre including painting and sculpture, textiles and metalwork, architecture and performance.</span><span class="deschide"> More than a recitation of periods, styles, and monuments, the course will assess the varieties of evidence available for interpretations of artworks that were created in diverse social, religious, and political settings.</span><br />

Under the violence of dictatorial regimes, social repression, and foreign intervention, artists across Latin America have turned to art and craft practices to protest and give visibility to the injustices plaguing their communities. In light of recent scholarship and exhibitions that have recently focused on the political and social climate in Latin America during the late twentieth century, this course surveys the ways in which art functioned</span><span class="deschide"> as a form of resistance, critique, and empowerment during the 1960s through the 1990s. Within this context, the course aims to foreground and critically engage with the practices of women artists working during this period, focusing on case studies across different regions.</span><br />

This undergraduate semiar examines the resurgence of craft within contemporary art and theory. In a time when much art is outsourced--fabricated by large stables of assistants--what does it mean when artists return to traditional, and traditionally laborious, methods of handiwork such as knitting, ceramics, or woodworking? Our readings will consider historical and theoretical questions of process, materiality, skill, bodily effort, gendered</span><span class="deschide"> labor, and alternative economies of production.</span><br />

This seminar investigates foundational principles of digital humanities though art history, cultural heritage and material preservation, with a particular focus on emerging threats to historic sites and objects. We will explore and engage with innovative technologies utilized to confront a variety of global challenges and provide ‘hands-on’ practical experience in laser scanning, photogrammetry, and digital mapping and much more. The seminar is thus a “journey” of</span><span class="deschide"> sorts, a dialogue with technology, art, materiality and historicities in an attempt to fully engage with cultural heritage issues through a twenty-first century lens. At the end of the semester, we will create an online portfolio/course website which showcases our work.</span><br />

Mimesis, Greek for &quot;imitation&quot; is a key term in recent debates in a number of disciplines. However, what is at its core is often astonishingly undefined, open and ambivalent. Starting with antique and medieval works addressing key moments of mimesis we will also explore modern theories of mimesis.

This seminar focuses on artworks made by migrating peoples chronicling their journeys (Hmong storycloths, Aztec codices), and artworks made by others who made migration a major theme (Dorothea Lange photographer of dustbowl migrants to California, Jacob Lawrence chronicler of the migration north of African Americans). Also, we focus on the arts of traditional communities that base their artifact production on longstanding, ecologically localized and distinctive</span><span class="deschide"> practices. Issues include nostalgia, memory, trauma; cultural heritage the selection of what is to be seen, remembered, recoiled from, embraced, what is to be taught to future generations/outsiders concerning fear, courage, pride, self-definitions, accusations, and authenticity.</span><br />
