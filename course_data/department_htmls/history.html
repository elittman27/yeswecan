History 1 introduces students to core dynamics of global history. Traversing the experience of human societies from earliest origins to the complex, chaotic, and cacophonous twenty-first century, the course highlights recurrent themes including the origins and development of political order; the evolution of interstate (or international) relations; and the historical advance of globalization. From this vast panorama, students will acquire a broad</span><span class="deschide">, even foundational, perspective on the human past and new insight into transcendent problems in the human experience.</span><br />

This course focuses on the history of global interaction, with a particular emphasis on the relationships between states and societies. Though it begins with a brief exploration of antiquity, it emphasizes world developments since the 15th century. The purpose of the course is to gain a better understanding of the rise and decline of states, empires, and international trading systems. Taking a panoramic view of the last 500 years, it explores the ways in which disparate</span><span class="deschide"> places came closer together, even while it seeks to explain how those places maintained their own trajectories in the face of outside intervention.</span><br />

A general introduction to the study of history, this course focuses on Byzantium and the Islamic world, two medieval successors to the Roman empire in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. This course has three aims: to provide an outline of events that transpired in this area from the 4th-15th centuries; to explain how a modern historian can approach medieval sources in order to reconstruct various aspects of the past; and to discuss the</span><span class="deschide"> commonalities of pre-industrial societies, and how lessons learnt in this class can be applied to the study of other time periods and geographic locations.</span><br />

This course surveys medieval European history from Constantine's conversion to Christianity in 310 to 1400, emphasizing the creativity of the new peoples populating Europe in adapting the heritage of the Roman world and the role of economic change in transforming European societies after the millennium. Topics include the development of kingship and states, courtly literary and material cultures, economic change, the environment, and religious</span><span class="deschide"> movements.

This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did &quot;western&quot; become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of &quot;modern&quot;.</span><br />

Science as we know is the product of a historical process. In this course, we will explore the emergence of its concepts, practices, goals, and cognitive authority by surveying its roots in their social and cultural setting.

The goal of this course is to foster a critical engagement with humanitarian interventions in Africa. Through this course, we will develop a better understanding of the complexity of humanitarianism and its often-unintended consequences in different parts of Africa. Our approach is not prescriptive in the sense that it provides a course of action or a politics to follow. Instead, we use historical methodology as an analytical tool in evaluating</span><span class="deschide"> the connections between humanitarianism and Africa over more than two hundred years.</span><br />

Neoliberalism has become a catch-word in social sciences. It is used by scholars from various disciplines and has different meanings. However, usually it is used to indicate some profound change that took place since the 1970s. Some even use it to describe the three decades that have followed the postwar period. In this seminar we will approach neoliberalism from a historical perspective, including the history of neoliberal ideas, neoliberal</span><span class="deschide"> transformations in a number of selected countries, the 2008-9 economic crisis, the neoliberalization of higher education, and the contentious relationship between neoliberalism and democracy.

In 2011, Bill Gates and David Christian launched a project for teaching “Big History” at high schools. In their definition, “Big History seeks to understand the integrated history of the Cosmos, Earth, Life, and Humanity, using the best available empirical evidence and scholarly methods.” The vocabulary, concepts, and environmental fears driving the project are distinctly twenty-first century. However, humanity has sought the exact same goals</span><span class="deschide"> for longer than two millennia already. The course will sample how ancient Greek philosophy and science were used in order to propose practically and morally relevant “Big History” at different times and places: Graeco-Roman antiquity, the Christian and Muslim Middle Ages, and the modern period.</span><br />

A paradox lies at the heart of our visions of present-day South Asia: on the one hand, the region has witnessed explosive economic growth, leading some to speak of the next hundred years as an ‘Asian Century’. On the other hand, the countries of the region remain beset by enormous challenges, from the shadow of terrorism, the threat of nuclear war, the increasingly rapid slide into authoritarianism, the growth of religious violence and fundamentalism</span><span class="deschide">, resource scarcity and the looming environmental catastrophe – to name only a few.

Child labor in Africa is a complex phenomenon that defies simple analysis or solution. It is claimed that about one third of all children under 14 years of age, are &quot;economically active&quot; This seminar seeks to examine diverse categories of child labor spawned by specific socio-cultural, religious, economic, and political contexts riddled with extreme poverty, and a hostile global environment. Sample topics to be explored include: definitions</span><span class="deschide"> of childhood and child labor; traditional constructions of children's work; colonialism, globalization and redefinition of children's work; gender and child labor; child abductions, child soldiers; sex slavery; and talibes.</span><br />

“Feminist history” is a term that encompasses a wide and rich range of histories of ideas, issues, movements, and contemporary controversies. In this seminar we will examine the history of feminist movements, anthropological descriptions of South Asian women’s lives and cultures, political tracts on contemporary issues with older genealogies, and historical/anthropological monographs dealing with specific scandals associated with women’s bodies</span><span class="deschide">, such as dowry murders, or honor killings. The seminar will progress thematically rather than geographically, and will address issues specific to the lives of women in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, from the early modern period through partition, and the post-nationalist milieu.</span><br />

This seminar explores the history of Shanghai as a place of interaction between China and the world during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Shanghai’s opening to foreign trade and residence after 1842 sparked its rapid growth into China’s largest metropolis, and one of the great cities of the world, less than a century later. We will focus on how the accelerating flow of people, goods, and ideas through Shanghai from across the world</span><span class="deschide"> and throughout China dramatically transformed the material and mental landscape of the metropolis, which in turn shaped the lives and identities of the many different groups of residents who crowded into its expanding borders.</span><br />

Ancient and medieval historians paid little attention to women. When they did, it was either to praise them lavishly or disparage them irredeemably. Their impoverished view of women’s lives stands in stark contrast to the material available from other sources, both textual and artistic. In this class we shall consider the gamut of women’s experiences, such as social, religious and gender roles, economic and legal rights, faith, passions, and</span><span class="deschide"> religious responsibilities. We will read about Greek priestesses and Christian martyrs, wives and queens, poets and benefactors. This class will be organized chronologically and will cover select topics from ancient Greece, Rome, and early Byzantium.</span><br />

In this connector course, we will explore how historical data becomes historical evidence and how recent technological advances affect long-established practices, such as close attention to historical context and contingency. Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history “count” more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time? During our weekly discussions, we will apply what we learn in lectures and</span><span class="deschide"> labs to the analysis of selected historical sources and get an understanding of constructing historical datasets.

This course examines the emergence and development of democracy in the ancient Greek world, from its tentative beginnings in the sixth century BCE to its most radical form in the fourth century. We will consider ancient evidence for the day-to-day workings of Athenian democracy and the emergence of democratic ideologies. We will explore the problems of leadership, citizenship, the size and structure of the Athenian population, decision-making</span><span class="deschide">, judicial procedure, punishment, and the tension between democracy and inequality. We will also read in their historical context some fierce ancient criticisms of democratic rule. We will explore the forces that undermined democracy in ancient Greece, and those that merely threatened to do so.</span><br />

It centers the experience of being Palestinian at home and in exile after the Nakba of 1948. In particular, it examines the origins of one of the longest running and most significant settler colonial realities in modern history. The course explores the history and ethics of Palestinian resistance to their dispossession</span><span class="deschide">, the literary and visual expressions of Palestinian identity, and the representations of the Palestinian struggle in the West. Using a broad range of primary sources, literary texts, and films, students will be encouraged to reflect upon Palestinian history on its own terms.</span><br />

This course explores African history before 1800: How and why did complex societies form in Africa? Why did states form in some place and times and not others? What technological responses did different Africans make to environmental changes? How did various cultures, religions, and state ideologies help to organize African social and political formations? What effect did the medieval and early-modern trade in African slaves have on African social</span><span class="deschide"> and political formations? We will attempt to answer these questions from both theoretical and historiographical perspectives by engaging with academic debates on some of these issues, and by looking at the viewpoints of African historical actors themselves using primary sources.</span><br />

Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of</span><span class="deschide"> women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the &quot;subaltern&quot; classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.</span><br />

This course explores Chinese history and culture in the period from the 7th to the 13th centuries, when China achieved unprecedented military, political, and cultural power in East Asia. It concentrates on the fundamental transformation of state and society that took place between the 8th and 12th centuries, and on the nature of the new &quot;early modern&quot; order that had come into existence by the end of the Southern Song. Topics of</span><span class="deschide"> special concern are economic and political power, technology, religion and philosophy, and poetry and painting.</span><br />

Between the 16th and the 19th century China was home to the world’s largest empire and economy. Beijing sat at the center of an East Asian order of trade, tribute, and learning. China reached the height of its continental power around 1800. Meanwhile Western European ships began sailing into East Asian waters. These ships facilitated long-distance exchanges of goods and ideas by the sea.<br/>
This course examines the question: What mattered</span><span class="deschide"> more in the shaping of modern China thereafter: the Inner Asian origins of the Chinese governing system or the dynamics of a globalizing maritime economy and society? To anchor the discussion, the course will focus on aspects of law and society.</span><br />

It is impossible to understand Chinese history and culture without knowing what ordinary people thought, felt, and believed. In this course, our primary concerns will be 1) the built environment -- village form, houses, temples; 2) village festivals and domestic rituals; 3) the rituals and scriptures of local cults; 4) operas, storytelling, and other forms of village entertainment; and 5) popular visual arts. These subjects will be studied</span><span class="deschide"> through both written and visual documentation.</span><br />

This course brings a thematic approach to the critical analysis of the visual in Chinese history. In focusing on key elements of material culture and emphasizing how they have been viewed at specific moments in Chinese history, the course teaches students of history how to achieve a more balanced picture of the past drawn from both visual and literary records. Inevitably, the course tries to determine for a particular temporal and geographical setting</span><span class="deschide"> what's ordinary or conventional and what's not; also to rethink the metaphors that currently dominate thinking about history in China. No prior acquaintance with Chinese history is required for the course.</span><br />

This course considers the history of Japan since the end of World War II, beginning with an exploration of the war itself and its complex legacy to the postwar era.

This course explores the history of the four continents on the Atlantic rim—Europe, Africa, North and South America—and their increasing interconnectedness in the wake of Columbus’s voyage in 1492. It takes the Atlantic Ocean and its peripheries as a common zone of interaction, where peoples, cultures, ideas, goods, foodstuffs, and pathogens came into contact from diverse regions. The course begins with a portrait of Amerindian, African, and</span><span class="deschide"> European civilizations c. 1400 and ends with an overview of the protracted struggles for decolonization and emancipation from slavery in the 19th-century Americas. Throughout these five centuries of profound transformation, we will study conflict and encounter between the region’s many diverse peoples.</span><br />

During the first half-century before World War II, the United States became an industrialized, urban society with national markets and communication media. This class will explore in depth some of the most important changes and how they were connected. We will also examine what did not change, and how state and local priorities persisted in many arenas. Among the topics addressed: population movements and efforts to control immigration; the growth</span><span class="deschide"> of corporations and trade unions; the campaign for women's suffrage; Prohibition; an end to child labor; the institution of the Jim Crow system; and the reshaping of higher education.</span><br />

Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part</span><span class="deschide"> of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.</span><br />

Latinx peoples are the largest U.S. minority group. How and why did so many different peoples come to be seen as like one another and as not “American”? Although often perceived as “aliens” or foreigners, Latinx peoples have lived in North America since before the nation existed. In the words of historian Vicki Ruiz, “Our America is American history.” As we move across Nuestra América from precolonial times to the present, we will examine diverse cultural</span><span class="deschide"> practices, social movements, processes of community formation, intellectual trajectories, and responses to U.S. empire and white supremacy. We will also consider how race, class, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity have shaped belonging and inclusion within Latinx communities.<br/></span><br />

This course introduces students to the history of Mexican and Mexican American peoples in the United States. It begins in the precolonial Americas with an emphasis on North America and the region that later became the U.S. Southwest, and it ends in our present moment. It contextualizes historical moments, processes, and ideologies that continue to shape the lives of Mexican Americans: conquest, capitalism, heteropatriarchy, mestizaje, and white</span><span class="deschide"> supremacy. Rooted in social history, the course emphasizes the struggles of everyday people to improve the circumstances of their lives. It asks students to examine U.S. history from the perspective of communities often erased in national narratives.</span><br />

The U.S. military has served as an engine of socio-economic mobility, and changes in its personnel policies often foreshadowed the reordering of American society. However, the U.S. military has also been a space in which the federal government actively discriminated against many Americans—people of color, women, immigrants, religious minorities, and queer people. This course is neither a history of American wars nor a traditional military history focused on battles</span><span class="deschide"> and strategy; rather it explores the social dynamics of the U.S. military from the American Revolution to the present and investigates how the military has reflected, resisted, influenced, and heralded social, cultural, political, and religious transformations in American life.</span><br />

This course surveys religion in the land that became the United States from colonial contact with indigenous people to the present with an emphasis on how religion has shaped, and been shaped by, the American experience. It addresses enduring tensions between the presence of religious diversity, the ideals of religious pluralism, and the desire for religious power. What are the relationships between various American religious traditions and American society, politics</span><span class="deschide">, and culture? How have religious groups articulated their values to address questions of law, politics, culture, and economics? How does religion intersect with race, class, gender, and sexuality to form American identities and transform religious communities?</span><br />

Our goal is to trace how ideas, whether they are dominant, challenging, or look back, have affected the ways in which Americans</span><span class="deschide"> live together. We will look at how intellectual life has empowered and expanded the capacity of Americans to understand their world and achieve goals more effectively.

As longstanding symbols in U.S. history and culture, “Wall Street” and “Main Street” refer to streets that intersect at right angles and places that represent the antithesis of each other: Wall Street is home to nefarious big banks run by greedy financiers, while Main Street is home to “mom-and-pop” shops patronized by people of modest means who live in the surrounding wholesome small towns.

This course will examine the history of American data collection and analysis, from the census to opinion polling to sports.

We will also analyze quantitative documents to learn about</span><span class="deschide"> the past—both through close reading and through aggregation and statistical analysis.

For most of human history, urban living has been the experience of a distinct minority. Only in the past two hundred years have the physicial spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States.

The early colonial period in the Americas is one of history’s most traumatic, astonishing, and consequential eras. This lecture class compares and contrasts histories of encounter, resistance, conquest, and colonization in three regions of indigenous America: Hispaniola, the Valley of Mexico, and the St. Lawrence River Valley. Each section will begin with regional geography and indigenous and European contexts on the eve of contact.

World War II lifted the U.S. from the Great Depression and launched a long economic boom that helped underwrite and propel efforts on behalf of greater racial equality and economic equity. As that boom began to fade in the late 1960s, America’s march toward greater racial equality foundered, while its march toward greater economic equity began to reverse course. The Civil Rights Era gave way to the New Gilded Age. This course will explore the political, legal, and</span><span class="deschide"> economic history of America’s struggles for racial equality and economic equity – and the relationship between them.</span><br />

This course surveys Cuban history, culture, and politics from the 15th century to the present. We will examine both the outsized role the island has played in world history and the dramatic ways world history has refracted through the island’s turbulent past. How has Cuban history and culture been shaped by its unique position in global geopolitics, at the crossroads of Europe, the Americas, and Africa? How have inhabitants of Cuba struggled against</span><span class="deschide"> ongoing relationships of colonialism and dependency with foreign powers? How have inhabitants of Cuba defined what it means to be Cuban both because of and in spite of these global forces? We will draw on a wide array of texts from long before the famous Revolution of 1959 to well after.</span><br />

This course explores the history of medieval England from the Norman Conquest of 1066 to the end of the Wars of The Roses in 1485. The conquest radically changed English politics and society. The new rulers drew the kingdom into the politics and conflicts of continental Europe. At the same time England expanded at the expense of its neighbors in the British Isles, and faced recurring internal conflicts among its aristocracy</span><span class="deschide"> and royal families. Alongside the history of kings and battles, we will study the economic, social, cultural and intellectual life of the realm, the development of its distinctive political and legal systems, and the social and religious upheavals which rocked England in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<br/></span><br />

This is a course about the history of Britain that asks why this small island nation was so central to how Europeans and others understood world history more generally. It looks at Britain as the paradigmatic venue of industrialization, class conflict or its absence, consumer culture, parliamentary democracy, religious tolerance, imperial expansion, and modernity generally. It begins with the aftermath of Europe's first revolution and ends with</span><span class="deschide"> the first world's fair, 1851's Great Exhibition.</span><br />

Was Britain the maker of the modern world? This small, cold, and wet island was the first to develop representative politics, to industrialize, to urbanize, and to infamously build a global empire. And yet it was unable to rid itself of ancient institutions like the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the established church. The class explores this paradox by tracing the rise, fall and reinvention of a ‘liberal’ political economy that laid out how markets</span><span class="deschide">, governments, empires, and even people, should work. It shows how people of color, as subjects of slavery and imperialism, as well as residents of Britain, were integral to this story. It concludes Britain did not make the modern world, the world helped make Britain modern.</span><br />

The eighteenth century in Europe witnessed a series of &quot;revolutions&quot;--intellectual, political, and to a lesser extent, social and economic--that together constitute the birth rites of modern European society and culture. Historians collectively agree that the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the European expansion of Napoleonic France were events of world-historical significance, yet the causes and precise meaning of these</span><span class="deschide"> events are the subjects of substantial disagreement. We will study the transformations of the eighteenth century that announced our modern world, and we will also try to make sense of the different ways that historians disagree about the meaning of what happened.</span><br />

Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the Soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and from</span><span class="deschide"> there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy.<br/>
The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of World War II.<br/></span><br />

It does so by presenting major thinkers and schools of thought and discussing the relevance of their theories for current economic, social, and ecological challenges. Among the thinkers that are covered are classical economists such as Smith, Malthus, and Ricardo, along with Marx, utilitarian and marginalist economists, as well as a number of</span><span class="deschide"> undogmatic and radical thinkers. The course will, furthermore, discuss the work of Keynes and the theories of his neoliberal critics. Finally, the course also looks at more recent developments such as feminist and environmental economics and economics of race and discrimination.</span><br />

The Second World War was destructive on a scale all its own: it was the first ideological war, not simply about territory, but about conflicting ideas on how governments should organize lives of their citizens.

This is an upper-division survey of French History from the Renaissance through the French Revolution (1500-1800). The course explores the economic, political and cultural factors that allowed France to emerge as the most powerful nation and global actor in Europe from the end of the middle ages to the reign of Louis XIV. We examine the extent of the kingdom's military, political and cultural influence and the realities of everyday life in 16th</span><span class="deschide"> and 17th century France. We then turn to the key developments of the eighteenth century—capitalism, colonialism, global conflict and Enlightenment—that led to the collapse of French monarchy in 1789 and the unfolding of the first democratic revolution in the West.</span><br />

This course explores modern France and its place in the world. We begin with the French Revolution, one of the truly earth-shaking events in history, and then we follow French history through a series of monarchical, authoritarian, and democratic regimes. In the process, we will also trace the emergence, expansion and decline of a great colonial empire. Issues of focus include French cultural and intellectual life; empire as a way of life not</span><span class="deschide"> only for colonists but also for those living in mainland France; religion; immigration; battles over “who is French”; and dramatic changes in French economy and society during the past two centuries.</span><br />

From the period of the Protestant Reformation to the era of enlightened despotism and the French Revolution, German history was characterized by severe conflicts and problems unresolved. Early Modern German history contains many lessons concerning the relationship of war and peace, of violence and toleration, of reform and renewal and the rejection of any change, of Baroque splendor and widespread misery, of some progress and much disappointment</span><span class="deschide">, in short: of a most complicated legacy for future generations.</span><br />

This course provides the essential foundation for understanding the catastrophic history of Germany in the 20th Century, as well as some of its successes. A central theme is the struggle to define and impose a single national identity on socially, culturally, and religiously diverse peoples in an age of Great Power conflict. Although the region now known as Germany will be the focus of our investigation, considerable attention will also be paid</span><span class="deschide"> to the Hapsburg Empire, for until 1866 Austria was officially a part of &quot;Germany&quot; and remained, for nearly a century thereafter, culturally and in popular consciousness a part of a &quot;Greater Germany.&quot;</span><br />

This course provides an introduction to Germany’s experience of the twentieth century, analyzed through the social and cultural history of its modern metropolis. Pivotal site for the collapse of four different Germanies between 1918 and 1989, Berlin has been the capital of imperialism, war and revolution, democracy, social reform and cultural experimentation, Nazism, genocide and urban warfare, Cold War division, student radicalism in the West</span><span class="deschide"> and Soviet-style Socialism in the East, and finally re-united Germany, haunted by the presence of the past.</span><br />

This course will focus on the history of Italy during a period when it was the leading center of European artistic and cultural production and the driving force in the revival of classical learning and literary ideals. This was the Italy of Raphael and Michelangelo, Ariosto and Alberti, Brunelleschi and Botticelli. At the same time, Italy was also a political battleground through most of this period, both in the realm of ideas and theory but also</span><span class="deschide"> in a literal sense. It was in Italy that &quot;the art of war,&quot; as Machiavelli called it, took center stage as the peninsula became one of the major theaters of war between the great powers of the age, France and Spain. The course will combine a study of the artistic, intellectual, religious, and political history of Italy in this period both as it developed internally and as it was related to the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean world. Requirements will include a midterm, a final, and an optional final paper.</span><br />

The Romanovs ruled Russia from 1613 until 1917, when revolutions swept them from power. In three centuries, they transformed it from a landlocked country, inhabited largely by ethnic Russians, into a sprawling, western-oriented, multi-ethnic empire, governing well over 100 million people across some 8.6 million square miles. This course will focus on the techniques of rule that the Romanovs used to maintain and expand state power. It will inquire</span><span class="deschide"> into the extent and limits of the reach of the administrative and military apparatus into subjects’ public and private lives. Nominally, Russia was an autocracy. How powerful were Russia’s Romanov autocrats in practice? What can the Russian experience teach us about the nature of the modern state?</span><br />

Nationalism, socialism, and gender defined collective and personal identity in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. As writers struggled to position themselves globally, they wondered whether Russia and the Soviet Union belonged to Europe or Asia. They also questioned elite culture amid economic and social oppression. For some, science and art held intrinsic value; others felt they must address social, gender, and ethnic disparity. As socialism</span><span class="deschide"> arose, so did debate as to which groups deserved greatest protection: agrarian laborers, industrial workers, ethnic minorities, or women. Perhaps, the family itself had to be abolished to achieve true equality. Readings will feature essays, articles, short stories, and novels.</span><br />

This course will examine the history of 20th-century Eastern Europe, understood as the band of countries and peoples stretching from the Baltics to the Balkans. Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, however, will receive special attention. Topics of study will include foundation of the national states, Eastern European fascism, Nazi occupation, contructing Stalinist socialism, the fate of reform communism, reconstitution of &quot;civil society,&quot;</span><span class="deschide"> and the emergence of a new Eastern Europe. Given the paucity of historical writings on the region, the course will make extensive use of cinematic and literary portrayals of Eastern Europe.</span><br />

This course uses the devices of historical and literary interpretation to expose and analyze some of the lines of political and cultural development that have led to the Poland we now know.Beginning with the awakening of modern Polish nationalism, it traces the emergence of this Poland through the rise of mass society; the horrifying and exhilarating spectacles of World War I and national and social revolutions; first experiments with modern</span><span class="deschide"> Polish statehood (especially policies toward ethnic minorities and socially marginalized groups); then the transformations wrought by a half century of totalitarian rule; ethnic cleansing, elite transfer, forces social stratification, and despite all of this, the defiant return of civil society.</span><br />

Once again, Europeans are questioning the limits of coexistence. Recently we have watched a refugee crisis unfold and in the process have reopened discussions regarding who “belongs” in Europe. This course approaches these vexing question from a unique historical perspective, that of coexistence and otherness in both the “old” and “new” Europe. Specifically our laboratory includes Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany. We will utilize five case</span><span class="deschide"> studies (the Jews of Europe; the Roma of Northern Bohemia; the Vietnamese in Prague, the Turkish in Germany and recent refugees across the EU) to better understand how ideas of “Europe” and “Europeaness” changed over the past century.</span><br />

This course will examine the impact of modern intellectual, political, cultural, and social forces on the Jewish people since the eighteenth century. It is our aim to come to an understanding of how the Jews interpreted these forces and how and in what ways they adapted and utilized them to suit the Jewish experience. In other words, we will trace the way Jews became modern. Some of the topics to be covered include Emancipation, the Jewish Enlightenment,</span><span class="deschide"> new Jewish religious movements, Jewish politics and culture, immigration, antisemitism, the Holocaust, and the state of Israel.</span><br />

This class treats France and the Francophone world as a laboratory for the study of Jewish civilization over the past millennium. France has the world’s second largest Jewish population outside of Israel. It has a rich and complex history that traces all the key developments of the Jewish experience since ancient times: expulsions and migrations; codification of Jewish law; religious reform; the rise of anti-Semitism and the tragedy of the Holocaust; struggles</span><span class="deschide"> between Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews; complex relations between Muslims and Jews; the emergence modern Jewish politics; and the impact of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

This is the fourth course in a four-course sequence in the history of Jewish culture and civilization. It explores the major themes in Jewish history from 1750 to the present, with special attention paid to the transformation of Jewish communal and individual identity in the modern world. Topics to be treated include the breakdown of traditional society, enlightenment and emancipation, assimilation, Hasidism, racial anti-Semitism</span><span class="deschide">, colonialism, Zionism, and contemporary Jewish life in Europe, North America, and Israel. The multicultural nature of Jewish history will be highlighted throughout the course through the treatment of non-European Jewish narratives alongside the more familiar Ashkenazi perspective.</span><br />

We move through topics that include the earliest encounters between Muslims and Jews during the years of the rise of Islam; the historical impact and legacy of the dhimmi (the system of rights and restrictions that defined Jews’ status for centuries under Islamic rule); the culturally fruitful shared</span><span class="deschide"> experience of Jews and Muslims in Medieval Spain and the Ottoman Empire; the effects of French, British, and Italian colonialism in the modern Middle East; and the important conflicts over Zionism and Arab nationalism during the past century.</span><br />

This course examines the establishment of the ideas and institutions of modern physics over the last century and a half.We begin with the 19th century organization of the discipline and the debates over the classical world picture (mechanics, electromagnetism and optics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics).We follow the dramatic changes that undid the classical picture, from the discovery of radioactivity through Einstein's theories of</span><span class="deschide"> relativity on to the creation of quantum mechanics and the accompanying philosophical disputes.Alongside these conceptual upheavals we will look at the evolving structure of the discipline, its links with industry and government, and the massive transformations of WWII, culminating in the atomic bomb.</span><br />

Where do science and technology come from? How did they become the most authoritative kinds of knowledge in our society? How do technology, culture, and society interact? What drives technological change? The course examines these questions using case studies from different historical periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a dimension of our modernity, and its relations to other traditions such as magic, religion, and art.</span><span class="deschide"> The aim of the course is for students to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how technological change is invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances.</span><br />

The history of medicine shows how societies have faced health crises in the past and how they have changed their approach to illness and disease over time. This class is a survey of the history of medicine in the U.S., focusing on changing concepts of disease, medical practices, institutions, patient experiences, and public health measures. In particular, the course examines how shifting ideas about gender, class, and race shaped experiences</span><span class="deschide"> of illness and suffering, as well as medical knowledge and education. While the course focuses on the history of American medicine, it acknowledges that changes in the practice, theory, and education of medicine often do not occur in isolation but are part of global developments.</span><br />

This course introduces the history of science, medicine and technology in modern East Asia—mainly China, Japan, Korea, and their inland and maritime peripheries—between the sixteenth and twenty-first centuries. The first half of the course examines the reconfiguration in understandings of the body and the natural world, as well as the politics of medicine and technology, during the transition from the early modern to the modern period. The second half puts this East</span><span class="deschide"> Asian reconfiguration into global perspective over the last century. A central goal will be to explore different methodological approaches including traditional history of science, social history, post-colonial studies, gender, translation studies, and material culture.</span><br />

This course examines the historical development of human rights to the present day, focusing especially (but not exclusively) on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. More than a history of origins, however, this course will contemplate the relationships between human rights and other crucial themes in the history of the modern era, including revolution, slavery, capitalism, colonialism, racism, and genocide. As a history of international and</span><span class="deschide"> global themes and an examination of specific practices and organizations, this course will ask students to make comparisons across space and time and to reflect upon the evolution of human rights in international thought and action—from imperial beginnings to the crises of our time.</span><br />

The course focuses on several crucial shipwreck narratives in Homer’s Odyssey, the Ancient Egyptian Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, Sophocles’ Philoctetes, a shipwreck survived by Apostle Paul, in imperial Roman romance novels, and in Shakespeare’s Tempest to examine long-distance trade and the impact of maritime catastrophes on narratives that encapsulate encounters with the divine, conversions, shifts in religious and personal identity</span><span class="deschide">, and concepts of paradise. We will look at ship-building innovations and trade routes to provide context and use cultural anthropology and literary theory to identify how the narrators use shipwrecks to fashion the relation between nature, the divine, and humans as individuals and members of a society.</span><br />

What is love? An instinct, a thing of nature? Or an idea, a product of culture? European philosophers since Plato have sought answers to these questions, advancing in the process various theories about the relationship between nature, culture, and the human condition. This class considers these theories as a starting point of an historical exploration of love as represented in a variety of cultural artifacts from ancient Greece through the Middle Ages. Among</span><span class="deschide"> them are the poetry of Sappho and Ovid; Greek and Roman sculpture; ancient, Byzantine, and medieval romances; marriage chests and wedding hymns; the letters of Abelard and Eloise; the New Testament and Augustine’s The City of God.</span><br />

This seminar provides a broad overview of the discipline of History. Beyond examining influential works that continue to shape how we write, teach, and think about history, it familiarizes students with important subfields of the discipline, and seminal thinkers who helped shape them. Though the course probes no topic or approach in depth, it does aim to facilitate a working knowledge of a range of methods and theoretical vocabularies with which</span><span class="deschide"> historians should be conversant.

This class explores what is happening to higher education and the historical profession in the contemporary world and how the job market for historians is changing. The aim is to demystify the academy and the historical profession while encouraging deeper thinking about career diversity and development. We will focus on practical questions like how and when you get your reading done, how you prepare for 3rd semester and qualifying exams, visit and use archives, develop</span><span class="deschide"> research skills, prepare grant proposals, build a CV/Resume, attend conferences and present papers, publish reviews and articles. It will also address how you survive this intensification of academic labor, addressing issues such as mental health and resources for parents.</span><br />

This class introduces graduate students to a variety of theories and techniques used in teaching history at the university. Through discussion, small group activities, and simulations, the course explores core ideas of history pedagogy. It addresses opportunities and challenges in teaching history as well as common classroom situations to develop the foundation for becoming teachers at Berkeley and beyond. The course has two primary goals:</span><span class="deschide"> (1) to prepare graduate students to teach effectively as GSIs in history classes at Berkeley; and (2) to introduce ideas, practices, and debates in teaching and learning to support graduate students' professional development into independent instructors, in and out of the classroom.</span><br />
