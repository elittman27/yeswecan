This course explores the role of race, racism and resistance in the United States from 1492 to the present. We do this by reading autobiographical works written by racial justice activists alongside works in the theory of racial formations. Together we ask: What is race? How do we define and recognize racism? How has race shaped the lives of Americans historically classified as minorities? And how have anti-racist intellectuals</span><span class="deschide"> represented the personal and political struggles of racialized communities living in a white majority culture? To answer these questions we focus on the intersections of race, class and gender; immigration, labor and democracy; and the history of resistance to racial oppression from abolition to liberation and back.</span><br />

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics. Data from various African</span><span class="deschide"> languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of African linguistic structure.</span><br />

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.
