This course explores the basic materials and models that set the boundaries for various present-day musical experiences. Students are exposed to terminology and modes of engagement with the aim of inspiring new paradigms of listening (e.g., listening to silence, noise, space, and timbre). Composers and musicians of today continue to explore new ways of defining and organizing sounds into music. The course focuses on the</span><span class="deschide"> most adventurous music of our time, but the concepts learned can be applied to any style of music. The course is designed to enrich and deepen the students' musical abilities through direct involvement with musical materials. Direct engagement through listening and participatory learning is accomplished in part with software created at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies. The course does not require students to be able to read music nor to own a personal computer.</span><br />

Radical Listening (MUS 31) considers music through the lenses of extra-musical epistemologies - aesthetics and philosophies related to culture, memory, identity, gender, etc. Listening to music with such considerations can foster and illuminate personal emotional stakes. Cultivating personal stakes in listening has the benefit of moving us towards a greater capacity for empathy - what we do in our most personal aesthetic spaces can project</span><span class="deschide"> outwards into how we engage with others, publicly, as caring citizens. Tactically, we will rehearse applying “radical listening” concepts on some of the most ubiquitous and influential music in Western culture in tandem with important, though esoteric, exponents of experimental music (e.g. Vocaloids).</span><br />

These tracks will demonstrate progressively advanced production techniques within the style(s) of music that students are interested in.<br/>
Demonstrate an increased awareness and use of musical terminology when discussing their own and other students’ tracks, based on an overview of relevant music theory concepts (writing chord progressions, rhythm and syncopation exercises).<br/>
Select a microphone (from a given list) to use in various recording contexts (which are based on the student setups in the class). If no fellow student setups allow, common recording studio contexts (i.e. 5 piece band, acoustic duo).<br/>
Set up and check from start to finish an Ableton Live session using their personal setup (could include analog/MIDI devices, microphones, acoustic instruments) or if none of the above, a setup with built in microphone and laptop MIDI keyboard. This includes recording and editing MIDI and Audio clips in both Session and Arrangement view while understanding the differences between them.<br/>
Understand and apply basic mixing and mastering techniques and plugins available in Ableton, including but not limited to: compression, EQ, delay, and reverb and the use of return tracks.</p></div>

This course is intended, above all else, to create the circumstances in which we will each independently develop as intimate a relationship as we can with Beethoven’s music. With an open mind and a bit of application, we ought to become well-acquainted with several of his compositions, extremely friendly with others, and perhaps even head over heals in love with a couple of them.<br/>
We’ll be seeking to understand this music through attentive listening and close technical</span><span class="deschide"> description, but also by looking at the historical environments in which it was composed, performed, and heard.<br/>
For that reason, we’re going to take a roughly chronological route through Beethoven’s life and works.</span><br />

This course considers select musical practices stemming from Latin America and its diasporic communities. Focusing on the 20th and 21st centuries, but tracing longer historical threads, we will study musics that go from the “folkloric” to the “popular,” the local to the transnational, and from south to north of the American continent. We will address these practices at the intersection of the “musical” and “cultural.” We will delve into historical and site-specific</span><span class="deschide"> issues of race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, migration, media capitalism, and power. We will query the role music has played in processes of identity formation and un/belonging in the context of Latin America and the communities this loaded signifier includes/excludes.</span><br />

Cumbia is a music found throughout the American continent. Though particular types of cumbia are found in most countries, they differ musically and contextually. This class focuses on local cumbia practices in and outside the Americas. Tracing its musical similarities and differences, as well as the circulation networks through which it has spread, the class disentangles cumbia’s convoluted genealogy and considers its many manifestations within their geopolitical</span><span class="deschide"> backdrop. Along the way, it also offers an overview of relevant sociopolitical issues in 20th and 21st century Latin America.</span><br />

This course explores the complex webs and flows of historical and contemporary transnational musical exchanges of Asian/Asian American popular music in the 20th and 21st centuries. For each musical practice, we will give attention to the histories of violence, im/migration, contested claims about national identity, and technological development that have produced the conditions in which the particular music was created. Resisting a monolithic imagination or understanding</span><span class="deschide"> of “Asia,” this course will show how popular musical practices enable us to “hear” a dynamic production of Asia through hidden histories, memories, distant places, social differences, struggles, and innovations that go far beyond geographic national borders.</span><br />

The course explores the intersection of music, politics, and social transformation through a survey of ethnographic accounts of musical protest from the US to Egypt, South Africa, Chile, Japan, and beyond. Examples will include songs that critique gender, class, and racial inequalities, violence, environmental damage, greed, complacency, and the notion of “protest music” itself. Students will examine what the function, potential, and limits of musical protest</span><span class="deschide"> have been in transforming civic life; the role of musical sounds in mediating and contesting oppressive regimes, structural inequalities, and social injustice; and how music might offer creative rethinking of the relationship between critical attention, compassion, and commitment.</span><br />

How might critical attention to sound and music yield a new insight into the interactions among societies and their environment? This course will examine how the ecological relationships between humans and their surroundings are expressed, sustained, and sometimes challenged through musical sounds. From bird songs in the rain forest to songs of the indigenous land rights movement in Australia, students will investigate how sonic/musical creativities have intersected</span><span class="deschide"> with the production, preservation, or destruction of ecologies—natural, social, cultural, or otherwise.

This course explores the intersections between aesthetic practice and social change. Students will investigate—in both theory and practice—the capacity of art making to cultivate transformation of themselves, their relationships, their practices, their institutions, and the larger economic and socio-political structures in which they function, locally and globally. Focusing on historical and contemporary artists and political issues, we ask:</span><span class="deschide"> 1) How is art impacted by social change? 2) How has art been used toward social change? and 3) How can we, as course participants, use art to bring about social change?</span><br />

This seminar explores the techniques of imaginative processes through which humans design alternative narratives, histories, futures, and subjectivities. Focusing on the musical and sonic, we examine how the musical imagination relates to other social and cultural processes by which we imagine culture into being. After a brief investigation of the anthropology of the imagination, we turn to the process of imagining the historical past; urban nostalgias and immigrant</span><span class="deschide"> cultures; transnational and diasporic imaginaries; and the dystopian imagination in music. We consider how and why music participates in the social life of romanticism and fantasy, and how these roles inform conceptions of music’s importance to and place in society.</span><br />

This seminar queries the relation between sound, technology, and power. Taking these three keywords/concepts as broad starting points, we will engage with theoretical approaches and case studies that span the emergence of recording technologies at the turn of the 19th century to algorithmic and robotic systems in the present. We will consider the avenues through which difference is represented, constructed, unsettled, and disturbed in music, films, archives, engineering</span><span class="deschide">, and software, among others. We will approach these matters from a variety of perspectives (e.g. Latin American, Chicanx, feminist, and Black radical intellectual genealogies) and academic disciplines (science, ethnic, media, cultural, border, and indigenous studies).</span><br />

Each monograph is paired with theoretical texts from various fields that have informed the analytical and methodological approaches taken by the author. Students will consider the new possibilities and limitations that sound offers us, not only as a scholarly subject but also a medium of creative</span><span class="deschide"> expression and social critique. Many authors will visit as guests—this will also provide an opportunity to inquire into the process of writing monographs; to learn how to generate generative and generous questions; and to ask how to participate in and create a scholarly community.</span><br />

This course introduces ethno/musicological approaches to the study of sexuality and gender. We will study scholarly works that consider how music informs and reflects cultural constructions of femininity, masculinity, and non-binary genders, and consider questions of sexuality within and apart from these frameworks. Taking wide-ranging examples that include popular music, folk and indigenous musics, and European art music, we will investigate</span><span class="deschide"> how gendered and sexualized subjectivities are negotiated through musical practices such as composition, performance, audition, and consumption. Class readings will include ethnomusicological, musicological, anthropological, feminist, Marxist, and queer theory approaches.</span><br />
