Participants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer; and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make</span><span class="deschide"> sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today.</span><br />

Can you live ethically without following moral norms, that is, norms as these are given institutionally and reinforced by culture and/or convention? The question, which is at least as old as the Cynics, gathered steam again in the nineteenth century starting with Nietzsche, and it remains a vital problem today. Paradoxical though it may seem, some of the staunchest critics of moral systems and moral norms are at the same time powerful advocates of non-normative</span><span class="deschide"> ethical reflection and action.

Science in public takes different shapes. It is defended as universal knowledge essential to human thriving. It is critiqued as a particular form of knowledge that does not take stock of the historical and social conditions imposing on its claims. It is dismissed or vilified as false or fake. How then does modern science relate to social and political values? Can and should scientific facts be independent of these values? In what ways are the</span><span class="deschide"> sciences constitutive of modern publics and republics? Should publics decide not only on the value of scientific projects, but on the truth of scientific claims?

How does one become more aware of oneself as mover, doer, learner, knower? How does one learn? Does one learn to do things with language - to read, to write, even to think - in the same ways as one learns to move? In this class, we will consider these sorts of questions through experiences with and responses to very basic movement lessons and to academic readings, as well as through writing and discussion. The primary aim is for you to become more aware</span><span class="deschide"> of the way you move and the way you use language and, through this awareness, to become more skilled at what you want to say and do.<br/>

This course investigates both the concept of history and the practice of historiography, using an engagement with the literal and metaphoric archives of the past to consider their empirical and philosophical claims on the present. While the methods, themes, and historical reach may vary, the course requires Rhetoric graduate students to investigate pre-1900 material in some form and to consider both the pragmatics of conducting historical inquiry</span><span class="deschide"> and the interpretive frameworks that structure them.</span><br />
