This is a Discovery Course for non-Biology majors designed to introduce lower-division college students to biology through the lens of the contemporary problems facing people, the planet and the species of the planet. Modern genetic contributions will be presented on such issues as genetic engineering of plants and animals, the emergence of new pathogens, the role of genetic variation among individuals, and the extent to which DNA is and</span><span class="deschide"> isn’t destiny.

That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

Discussion of how infectious agents cause disease and impact society at large. We will examine historical and current examples of plagues and pandemics and consider the question of what we should do to ameliorate the impact of infectious disease in the future. The course is intended for non-majors and will begin by briefly providing necessary background in microbiology and immunology. The primary focus in each subsequent</span><span class="deschide"> week, however, will be on discussing a particular infectious disease.

This lab course is an introduction to mammalian neuroanatomy for non-MCB majors. We will do dissections, explore physical anatomical models, and observe microscopic structures within preserved brain slices from a variety of mammalian species. The hands-on exploration of anatomy is key to understanding how the different functional regions of the nervous system are interconnected. Besides gaining a better understanding of anatomy, you will gain</span><span class="deschide"> important scientific skills such as conducting parts of a neurological exam, fluorescent and light microscopy, reading MRI scans and conducting fine dissections. The course will culminate with a group project using the online Allen Brain Atlas to investigate a novel scientific question.</span><br />

Advances in neuroscience are forcing us to confront anew questions concerning the nature of identity, reality, morality, and free will. Scientists can now implant artificial memories, augment natural brain capabilities, and read out intentions from the brain before they are acted upon. This class intends to shine a light on the brave new world enabled by modern neuroscience through three lenses: science, film, and philosophy. Topics to be covered include: the architecture</span><span class="deschide"> of the brain, AI &amp; the mind body problem, the neural construction of reality, action and free will, memory, the neural basis of morality, mechanisms for brain wiring, mental illness, and brain machine interfaces.</span><br />

We will work with a variety of datasets that describe a molecular view of cells and how they divide. We will learn about the processes that cause cells to become specialized (differentiate) and to give rise to cancer (transform). We will analyze data on genetic mutations in cancer that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells. We will learn how mutations are detected by the immune system and the basis of cancer immunotherapy. Finally we will analyze</span><span class="deschide"> data on clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy to define the correlates of success in curing the disease. The students are expected to gain an understanding of data that reveals the basics of cell physiology and cancer, how immunotherapies of cancer work and their current limitations.</span><br />

This lab course will familiarize students with general principles of drug discovery and action. The first module focuses on aspects of small molecule function by comparing stoichiometric inhibitors and PROTAC molecules against the BTK kinase. Students will learn how to purify protein, monitor drug binding and in vitro efficiency, and determine effects on cell survival. The second module focuses on genomic therapies by introducing students to principles of CRISPR</span><span class="deschide"> genome editing. Students will design genome editing strategies and cognate guide RNAs and then perform an editing experiment that replaces a catalytic Cys residue in BTK with Ser. Students will compare stoichiometric inhibitors against BTK to PROTAC in wildtype or mutant cells.</span><br />

The overarching goal of MCB 153 is to inform our MCB majors how therapeutics are developed and created. After completing this course, students will have a firm understanding on the mechanism of action of several therapies used to fight disease. The course will cover areas such as the discovery and refinement of antibiotics, anti-virals, cancer therapies, CRISPR0-based therapies. Furthermore, MCB 153 will delve into disease areas not covered in</span><span class="deschide"> other courses, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disease. Lastly, MCB 153 will implement a “case study” for each topic displaying real world challenges and solutions to treating complex diseases.</span><br />

This course is intended for graduate students in the early stages of their thesis research who are contemplating using modern microscopy tools as part of their work. It endeavors to cut through the confusion of the wide array of new imaging methods, with a practical description of the pros and cons of each. In addition to providing an intuitive physical understanding how these microscopes work, the course will offer hands on experience with</span><span class="deschide"> cutting-edge microscopes where students will be able to see firsthand how different imaging modalities perform on their own samples, and where they will be able to access computational tools for the visualization and analysis of their data.</span><br />

Research in our lab is focused on the cell biology of mammalian fertilization. Our lab uses biophysical, biochemical, and molecular genetics methods to study sperm ion channels and transporters that regulate sperm motility, chemotaxis, and the acrosome reaction. A better understanding of these processes will eventually lead to the development of effective tools to control and preserve male fertility, improve the reproductive health of human population</span><span class="deschide"> worldwide, and advance family planning.</span><br />
