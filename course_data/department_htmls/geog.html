The intersection of nature, identity, and politics pepper the pages of newspapers almost every day from stories of toxic waste sites, crime, genetic engineering to indigenous struggles, and terrorist tendencies.

The goals of this introductory Earth System Science course are to achieve a scientific understanding of important problems in global environmental change and to learn how to analyze a complex system using scientific methods. Earth System Science is an interdisciplinary field that describes the cycling of energy and matter between the different spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere) of the earth system. Under</span><span class="deschide"> the overarching themes of human-induced climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss, we will explore key concepts of solar radiation, plate tectonics, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the history of life on Earth.</span><br />

In this course, students will observe and analyze how the American city has been built, experienced, imagined, and transformed. Using recent scholarship and primary sources, we will track the historical evolution of the city and assess change and continuity in major themes of urban life: race, gender, and difference, industry and labor, community and culture, and power and politics. These themes become increasingly</span><span class="deschide"> intertwined throughout the course.

Since the late 1990s, Oakland has experienced considerable racial and economic restructuring. Oakland’s formerly prominent Black population has dwindled precipitously, as the city lost nearly 25% of its Black population since 2010. Cultural institutions, like churches, barbershops, blues clubs, and restaurants that once served its vast working-class population were replaced by trendy shops and hipster outlets. Students will engage the sense of</span><span class="deschide"> loss and possibility arising in the city as they participate in a series of in-class workshops to learn various field methods. They will also work in neighborhoods with community leaders and groups to document residents’ valued places and how these places have changed over time.<br/></span><br />

Black Geographies considers the concept of geography to examine multiple orientations through engaging critical race, black feminist, diaspora and queer studies. The course covers approaches to the geographical categorization of blackness through two organizing frameworks. The first, the ‘black geographic,’ ‘geography’ serves as a productive analytic for examining the lived experiences, conceptual limits, and theoretical purchase of blackness through the reading</span><span class="deschide"> of some seminal and contemporary texts by black geographers. The second, ‘geographic blackness,’ considers how blackness as a modality of analysis gives insight and shape to the discipline of geography through texts by non-geographers that engage or invoke geographic themes.</span><br />

This course surveys the historical relationship between fossil fuels and the capitalist economy. Beginning with the origin of intensive fossil fuel use in the early modern world, and then moving through the industrial epochs of coal and then oil, this course asks how have fossil fuels shaped the trajectory of our modern economic world? Students will investigate the broad, structural</span><span class="deschide"> impact these resources have had on labor relations, economic development, culture, the environment, politics, and more. Framed around the current, contested transition off of coal, oil, and gas, this course also asks what the future of fossil fuels look like.

This course examines the fundamentally geographic nature of our current, historically unique system of material reproduction—capitalism—and how capitalist logics have shaped places and forms of life over the course of the system’s growth and change. We will explore how capitalist processes shape the rise (and inevitable fall) of places, techniques, social worlds, and divisions of labor, and pay close attention to the power relations and spatial</span><span class="deschide"> organization that accompany them. The course provides a grounding in critical perspectives such as the Marxian, Black radical, and feminist traditions to equip students with theoretical tools to understand and interpret the spatiality of contemporary capitalism.</span><br />

Postcolonial studies focus on how processes of colonialism/imperialism continue even after the formal dissolution of empire. A central argument of this course is that critical human geography can make important contributions to understanding the interconnections between forces at play in different parts of the world.

This course explores historical, cultural, and socio-economic geographies of cities, city life, and the organization of metropolitan political power. It is primarily focused on the U.S., but will draw on select examples from abroad. We will investigate urbanization as a general process and the resulting physical, social, cultural, and political economic forms of cities and examine the ways that cities have addressed tensions emerging from segregation</span><span class="deschide"> and urban renewal. We will also look at both the ways in which social inequality is reinforced through the politics, policies, and design of the built environment as well as strategies for fostering and nurturing inclusive and equitable urban spaces through city design and policy.</span><br />

Cities as the economic engines of capitalism, centers of industry, finance, business, consumption, and innovation.

Cities as magnificent constructs, built of concrete, credit and land rents</span><span class="deschide">, from skyscrapers to housing tracts, freeways to shopping malls, airports to open spaces.

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today.

Through class discussions and homework assignments students will learn of historic climate catastrophes, how different societies have responded and what we can learn from these responses in terms of building climate resilience. We will go through simplified physical processes associated with recent climate events and delve into the details of how they occur and to what extent climate extremes are trending. One of the important learning objectives is to provide dual learning, that is, I propose to offer upper level undergraduates that lack sufficient mathematics and physics, while at the same provide graduate students and atmospheric science/statistics undergraduates a detailed understanding of climate impacts and risks. Graduate students have an augmented set of homework problems.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> An expected learning outcome is the ability to articulate climate risk with clear descriptions of mechanisms of change, degree and likelihood of impacts and methods of risk reduction. This class and Climates of the World will essentially be a two-semester sequence that (1) introduces students to the basic concepts of meteorology, climate change, climate extremes and (2) the types of risks and strategies that are currently being implemented and are in planning stages.</p></div>

What is America as a landscape and a place, and how do we know it when we see it? This course seeks to address such questions, to introduce ways of seeing and interpreting American histories and cultures, as revealed in everyday built surroundings—homes, highways, farms, factories, stores, recreation areas, small towns, city districts, and regions. It does so through the lens of cultural geography, an interdisciplinary practice that developed, in part, here</span><span class="deschide"> at Berkeley. Our goal in this course is thus twofold: First, to develop literacy in the role of space and place in American culture, and second to develop a working knowledge of cultural geography as a practice.</span><br />

A spatial analytic approach to digital mapping and GIS. Given that recording the geolocation of scientific, business and social data is now routine, the question of what we can learn from the spatial aspect of data arises. This class looks at challenges in analyzing spatial data, particularly scale and spatial dependence. Various methods are considered such as hotspot detection, interpolation, and map overlay.

The class has several goals. One is to give students a sound basis upon which to judge arguments. A second is to help students see, think, and write geographically--that is, to interpret the making and meaning of our physical and human landscapes. A third goal is to introduce students to the tremendous range of geographical inquiry and what is probably the major strength of geography as a form of thought: to wit, making links across space, among</span><span class="deschide"> peoples, and between humans and the earth. The fall semester class also serves to introduce students to the practices and expectations of scholarly work more generally, including professionalization, publishing, and public speaking.</span><br />

'Geographical Difference/Differentiation' is a 5 unit course with Seminar and Workshop components. The Seminar reads canonical work in social theory against contemporary Geography, including metropolitan traditions of critique of capitalism, urbanization, space and time, discipline-biopower-sovereignty, and the now; Southern traditions of agrarian, subaltern and materialist postcolonial studies; Black radical and oceanic traditions that stretch</span><span class="deschide"> Geography in new ways; and finally, geo-graphy as a form of Earth-writing concerned with the unraveling subject, ruined landscapes mixtures of form. The Workshop runs in parallel on particular weeks, focusing on geographic problematization and the research process.</span><br />

The relationship between societies and natural environments lies at the heart of geographical inquiry and has gained urgency as the rate and scale of human transformation of nature have grown, often outstripping our understanding of causes and effects. The physical side of environmental science has received most of the emphasis in university research, but the social basis of environmental change must be studied as well. Recent developments in social</span><span class="deschide"> theory have much to offer environmental studies, while the latter has, in turn, exploded many formerly safe assumptions about how and what the social sciences and humanities ought to be preoccupied with. This seminar allows students to explore some classics in environmental thought as well as recent contributions that put the field on the forefront of social knowledge today.</span><br />

This graduate seminar explores the inextricable connection between blackness and geography.<br/>
Considering Katherine McKittrick’s claim that Black geographies are “‘the terrain of political<br/>
struggle itself’ or where the imperative of a perspective of struggle takes place,” we will situate<br/>
the spatial relations of blackness by placing Black people at the core of spatial production and<br/>
examine the mechanisms by which this takes</span><span class="deschide"> place. In this course we ask: what are the<br/>
limitations and possibilities of traditional geographies? How does Black geographic thought<br/>
produce wider material and conceptual space for geographic knowledge? How does Geography<br/>
account for and understand blackness as condition, experience, and imaginary?</span><br />

Each text that falls under the “Black Spatial Matters” category will be followed by a corresponding “Black Space Matters” text. The two texts should be thought directly in relation to one another. Throughout the course we will engage such themes as Black cities, Black economies, Black poetics, and Black value by drawing on intellectual histories and politics of Black feminist, queer, indigenous, post-colonial, and critical race studies.<br/></p></div>

We grapple with what &quot;value&quot; means in &quot;Capital&quot;, paying particular attention to issues of historical specificity, abstract labor time, and the &quot;value theory of labor.&quot; We spatialize the argument by a close reading of David Harvey, and we look at attempts to understand capital's relation</span><span class="deschide"> to human action and other forms of value, in anthropology and the work of Pierre Bourdieu.

This class will introduce the theory, background, and practice of (analog) gaming, and simulation, or, more generally speculative world-building. These activities are increasingly important in contemporary culture, and also in science, policy, business, planning, and government, in situations where understanding how the world works, how the world might work, or how things might work differently are important.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> This class is a revised version of a class called ‘Spatial simulation modeling’ (Geography 228), but replaces computer simulation with board games as a vehicle for exploring how to abstractly represent processes and relations in the world. The aim is to develop an understanding of practices of ‘world-building’, using board games as an accessible point of entry to these practices. To do computer simulation requires learning how to program (‘to code’ as people insist of calling it today), which is a fine ambition but is distinct from the much more fundamental practices of abstraction, quantification, systems analysis, and so forth that underpin building simulation models. Working with board games instead of computational models will helps us get to the heart of those practices a lot more easily without the distraction of learning to program.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> It is important to note that this is not a game design class; it is not a game theory class; and it is not a cultural studies of games class, although students may learn a little (or even a lot) about all these things, particularly the first. We will look at a lot of games during the semester, as a way to understand games as systems of interacting mechanics, preparatory to student projects which will develop either entirely new games or (probably more likely) develop variants of existing games to align the game’s model of the world more closely with aspects they wish to explore.</p></div>

Technology shapes how land is known, used, valued and imagined. This seminar responds to how 21st century digital innovations are changing real estate planning and development; the commodification and trade of land, housing, and property; and politics and practices of dwelling globally. We will develop theoretical perspectives on what the digital brings to property via case studies of cloud computing, urban housing, and agrarian and rural land.<br/></span><br />

This course introduces graduate students to a range of applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in geographical research, and theoretical considerations of the meaning, strengths, and limitations of the methods. We first review, in general, how geographic variables can be represented in a database. This leads to an extended discussion of the application of GIS methods to a variety of problems in physical and human geography, using topographic data, census</span><span class="deschide"> data, and other sources, manipulated by widely used GIS software. Students build skills and understanding through work on example problems. Finally, the broad question of how GIS represents geographic variables, and the strengths and limitations of the technique, are re-visited using perspective gained from examples. Students will be expected to elaborate these issues in the context of their own research programs.</span><br />

This course centers the work of teaching as a foundational aspect of our practice as geographers. Undoubtedly, the interdisciplinary nature of geography provides multiple avenues from where we can address some of our most pressing social, environmental, economic and political dilemmas. But how do we bring theory to practice? And how do we do this in a classroom setting? To answer these questions, this course offers pedagogical frameworks and practical skills</span><span class="deschide"> for how theory and practice connect for both instructors and students. We will begin with a review of pedagogical literature and an analysis of how foundational scholars like Paulo Freire and bell hooks approach teaching as an act of community-making and empowerment.</span><br />
