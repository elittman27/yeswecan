Math is the natural language of physics. Of central importance to nearly all areas of physics are the fields of linear algebra and differential equations. A solid understanding of the structure and techniques of these fields will allow you to dig deeper into all of your physics courses and give you a greater appreciation of the beauty of physical theory. In this course we will develop and explore</span><span class="deschide"> a collection of tools including complex numbers, linear algebra, differential equations, Fourier series and transform methods, and tensors. Along the way this course will explore many example systems you were exposed to in your introductory physics classes including waves, circuits, rotations, and oscillations.</span><br />
