The goal is to give you the practical knowledge you need to create effective tools for both exploring and explaining your data. Exercises throughout the course provide</span><span class="deschide"> a hands-on experience using relevant programming libraries and software tools to apply research and design concepts learned.</span><br/>

increased considerably in importance since 1995, as researchers have learned to think<br/>
creatively about how to generate data in more scientific ways, and developments in information<br/>
technology have facilitated the development of better data gathering. Key to this area of inquiry is<br/>
the insight that correlation does not necessarily imply</span><span class="deschide"> causality. In this course, we learn how to<br/>

Understanding language is fundamental to human interaction. Our brains have evolved language-specific circuitry that helps us learn it very quickly; however, this also means that we have great difficulty explaining how exactly meaning arises from sounds and symbols.
