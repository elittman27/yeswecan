This is a project-based class in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theatre, design, and art practice. They will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded in a brief weekly lecture</span><span class="deschide"> that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.<br/></span><br />

How might we characterize California? Who lives here &amp; what are the stories we tell about them? This course takes California as the site through which to explore how cultural systems of performance help shape social systems of race, considering the role performance forms–theater, film, tourism, pageants, political protests–have played in shaping California’s unique cultural and racial topography.</span><span class="deschide"> From the theatricalization of Chinatown in Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum Song to that of urban riots in Twilight, from the staging of Latinx farmworker’s rights to those of post-war African American workers of the Great Migration, performance strategies have been used by a variety of agents towards a range of social &amp; political goals.</span><br />
