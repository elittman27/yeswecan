This course intends to introduce chemical engineers to the essential concepts of bioprocessing for applications in the biopharmaceutical, industrial biotech, and food tech industries. The course focuses on the use of chemical engineering skills and principles, including but not limited to kinetics and reactor design, thermodynamics and transport phenomena in the analysis and design of biologically-based processes, as well as the economical</span><span class="deschide"> analysis and ethics. The main emphasis of 170B, the second of a two-semester sequence will be on the downstream bioprocess of recovery, separations and purification of bio-based products.</span><br />

It focuses on real-life practices and challenges of translating scientific discovery into commercial products. Its scope is limited in most circumstances to situations where some knowledge of chemical engineering, chemistry, and related disciplines might prove to be particularly useful. The course primarily uses case studies of real-world</span><span class="deschide"> new product development situations to simulate the managerial and technical challenges that will confront students in the field. We will cover a wide range of topics including basic financial, strategic and intellectual property concepts for products, managing risk and uncertainity, the effective new product development team, the evolving role of corporate R&amp;D, the new venture product company and the ethics of post-launch product management.</span><br />

This course is part of the Product Development Program initiative sponsored by the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The course builds on the coverage in Chemical Engineering 295P of real-life practices of translating scientific discovery into commercial products. In this course, we will cover a new risk-reduction methodology for bringing to market complex technical inventions that initially have a high risk profile that discourages investment</span><span class="deschide"> for commercialization. The central learning objective in this course is: How might we utilize a new approach that would enable university-affiliated hard-tech innovators to sufficiently de-risk their venture propositions so that they become “fundable” by investors?<br/></span><br />
