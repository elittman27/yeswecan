This course provides a multidisciplinary introduction to the Middle East, an area that has long dominated the news but remains relatively unknown to most Americans. In a broad sense, the Middle East refers to “Arab” countries in general as well as Israel, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and the region of Kurdistan. The course aims to help students expand their knowledge and understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that</span><span class="deschide"> underlie current events and politics in the Middle East. We will examine the interplay of cultures, societies, and economies of various regional communities that remain central to the dynamics of Middle Eastern identities.</span><br/>

Ancient Egypt has fascinated visitors since antiquity to our modern imagination. From mummies, pyramids, and enchanting mythologies, these fanciful ideas have made their ways into books, movies, cartoons, and music. This course will explore the way ancient Egypt has been “consumed” in the West from the Napoleonic campaign to modern pop culture. We will study the impact that ancient Egypt and its wonderful monuments and civilization has had on art, literature, music</span><span class="deschide">, and even a number of religious and spiritual movements in the West as well as in Middle Eastern and African cultures.</span><br/>

Disease is a constant of the human condition. Like health, it is both a social construct and a physical reality. Epidemics are diseases that affect very large numbers of people; pandemics are epidemics with a passport—they spread over multiple countries and often continents. In this course we will survey, compare, and contrast ancient and modern conceptions of disease and health, and medicine and doctors, and examine and evaluate what evidence exists—historical</span><span class="deschide">, textual, archaeological--for identifying epidemics and pandemics in ancient times.</span><br/>

The most famous of Babylonian heroes is Gilgamesh, King of Uruk. The Gilgamesh Epic, recorded on twelve tablets in cuneiform, follows him in his quest for fame and eternal life. In this course, we will read the Gilgamesh Epic as well as several earlier texts around the same character. Moreover, we will read additional ancient texts that elucidate one or another aspect of the Epic. We will follow the traditions around Gilgamesh and see how his fame</span><span class="deschide"> was used for literary, religious, and political purposes. Finally, we will look at some of the modern Gilgamesh interpretations.</span><br/>

Today, much of the information we gather on any topic comes from Internet sources. Goal of this class is to increase students' skills in critically evaluating the scholarly value of information on the Ancient Near East that is to be found in web pages, e-journals, and online books. We will consider the goal and context of sources of information (touristic, commercial, scholarly, religious, etc.) and how this influences and filters the information provided. Although</span><span class="deschide"> the class will focus on Internet resources, we will not neglect to use the same critical eye when using print media. The class will feature a number of collaborative projects in which this critical attitude may be practiced.</span><br/>
