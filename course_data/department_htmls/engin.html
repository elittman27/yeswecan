Students will be introduced to research opportunities on campus and at nearby lab facilities through tours of lab spaces throughout the department and field trips to LBNL and LLNL.<br/>
<br />Students will be introduced to core concepts in nuclear science, statistical analysis, and computation, while being given practical experience applying those concepts to radiation detection and data analysis.<br />The objective of this course is to provide Freshman and Sophomore students with an introduction to the fundamentals of nuclear radiation and radiation detection through a hands-on approach.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Be able to outline and carry out a research project, prepare written and oral presentations of that work, and demonstrate how the sensors they built work.<br/>
By the end of this course, students should be able to:<br/>
Identify types of radioactivity, radiation detection methods and sources of environmental radiation,<br/>
<br/>
Create simple circuit designs making use of standard circuitry components, demonstrate basic soldering skills, and demonstrate a familiarity with printed circuit board design tools,<br/>
Make use of software tools including the Python programming language, version control with git, and shell environments,<br/>

This writing-intensive course surveys and analyzes accounts of AI-generated<br/>
writing, while reflecting on the ramifications of AI for human writing practices. In other<br/>
words: how do we write about—as well as with—writing machines? How are emergent AI<br/>
writing technologies reshaping human writing cultures in STEM fields and beyond? How,<br/>
in turn, do accounts of and interactions with writing machines shape cultural conceptions<br/>
of human writers</span><span class="deschide"> and thinkers, as well as technological frontiers for AI developers? What<br/>
does it mean to write for someone else, or to let someone or something else write for us?<br/>
How do preoccupations fundamental to all writing—audience, context, aims, and<br/>
aesthetics—shape both non-human and human writing?</span><br />

The physics of water ﬂow is an enabling element in technologies both new &amp; old. The physics concepts are straightforward, but require careful treatment to get meaningful results about water ﬂow. This is because water shows patterns that emerge from the sum of many small motions and are not predicted easily The challenge for a working engineer or manager is knowing when “emergent” patterns can be reliably extrapolated from one system from another, when they can</span><span class="deschide"> be controlled, and how they connect to the laws of physics when a “sanity check” is needed. This course examines key principles in water physics through a lens of contemporary technology including membranes, turbines, ﬂow cytometers, treatment ponds, gas exchangers &amp; atomizers.</span><br />

Optimization theory concerns the selection of a best option from a set of available options. Formulating an optimization problem involves describing the feasible set as well as prescribing a notion of “best”.

Designed for MEng and MTM students, this course explores key topics using the case discussion method. We will discuss technology strategy with the following meta themes; we will open with a case that applies traditional strategy analysis, contrast the traditional framework with new conceptions of platforms and competition. We’ll come to understand traditional economies of scale and barriers to entry and contrast those with network dynamics</span><span class="deschide">, winner take all markets, and platform strategy. Finally, we will critique platform competition and debate how platforms and their competitive dynamics will change business and society.</span><br />

This course is designed to give students a broad overview of the main topics encompassed by management of technology. It includes the full chain of innovative activities beginning with research and development and extending through production and marketing. Why do many existing firms fail to incorporate new technology in a timely manner? At each stage of innovation, we examine key factors determining successful management of technology. What</span><span class="deschide"> constitutes a successful technology strategy? The integrating course focus will be on the emergence of the knowledge economy and technology as a key knowledge asset and will involve both general readings and cases. The course also introduces students to Haas and COE faculty working in the relevant areas.</span><br />

This course is designed to examine the strategic issues that confront the management of the development stage biotech company, i.e., after its start-up via an initial capital infusion, but before it might be deemed successful (e.g., by virtue of a product launch), or otherwise has achieved &quot;first-tier&quot; status. Thus, the intention is to study the biotech organization during the process of it growth and maturation from an early stage existence</span><span class="deschide"> through &quot;adolescence&quot; into an &quot;adult&quot; company. The focus of the class will be on business development, i.e., the deal making that must occur to accomplish the corporate objectives of bringing in new technologies and getting the initial products to market. We will explore the critical deal issues from both the perspective of the development stage company and the viewpoint of the larger, more mature biotech or big pharma company with which it seeks to partner.</span><br />

This course seeks to make sense of, inter alia, the decline and prospective recovery of U.S. high-technology industries, the evolution of innovation and technology strategies and policies in Western Europe and Asia, the historic and current roles of governments in shaping markets for high-technology goods, and the impact on business strategies of recent developments in early-stage capital markets. Our general approach views technological innovation and competition</span><span class="deschide"> as dynamic processes that reflect previous choices made by firms and governments. Modern technologies develop in markets that are international scope, often imperfectly competitive, and subject to influence by a variety of economic and political stakeholders. We will use an eclectic mix of theoretical, historical, and practical perspectives throughout the course in examining these issues, although no special familarity with any of these is assumed. From time to time, we will be joined by venture capitalists, corporate executives, and technologists engaged in global high-technology markets for discussion of these issues.</span><br />

This course will provide you with a comprehensive view of the elements of modern project management, guidelines for success, and related tools. In organizations today, successful operations keep the organization alive and successful projects move it towards strategic objectives. A project is a one-time or infrequently occurring operation with a unique goal, limited lifespan, and limited resources. The fundamental concepts come from the field</span><span class="deschide"> of operations management, but projects present special types of operations because of their intended focus, limited lives, constraints, and uncertainties. In organizations today, projects are many, diverse, and frequently overlapping.</span><br />

This course involves the flows of materials and information among all of the firms that contribute value to a product, from the source of raw materials to end customers. Elements of supply chain management have been studied and practiced for some time in marketing, logtistics, and operations management. We will attempt to integrate these different perspectives to develop a broad understanding of how to manage a supply change. This course will focus</span><span class="deschide"> on effective supply chain strategies for companies that operate globally with emphasis on how to plan and integrate supply chain components into a coordinated system. You will be exposed to concepts and models important in supply chain planning with emphasis on key trade offs and phenomena. The course will introduce and utilize key tactics such as risk pooling and inventory placement, integrated planning and collaboration, and information sharing. Lectures, Internet simulations, computer exercises, and case discussions introduce various models and methods for supply chain analysis and optimization.</span><br />
