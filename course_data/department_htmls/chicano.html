What is culture, and who are Latinx people? This class is an introduction to how culture is studied, who Latinx people are, and the cultural expressions of Latinx people. We’ll begin by analyzing how scholars have studied culture, focusing on the three broad categories: folk culture, pop culture, and what had long been referred to as “high” culture but is now described as “cultural production.” We’ll also study the demographic diversity of</span><span class="deschide"> the Latinx community, reviewing the history and growth of these communities. The bulk of the semester will focus on Latinx folk culture, pop culture, and cultural production. Topics may include curanderismo, carne asadas, quinceañeras, religion, music, movies, poetry, art, and novels.</span><br />

Latinas/os have long been the object of intellectual thought: they have been written about, they have been studied and quantified, and quite often not in positive terms. In this course, we will turn Latinas/os from objects of discourse to subjects of discourse, as active participants in intellectual thought.

In doing so</span><span class="deschide">, we will counter the general notion that Latina/o intellectual thought is, at best, a recent phenomenon or, at worst, non-existent.</span><br />
