The main tool that the course will make use of is financial derivatives. An important</span><span class="deschide"> aspect of the study of derivatives is the valuation method, which provides an understanding of the market prices and can be used to evaluate investment opportunities, corporate securities, and others.

In this course, students learn to design financial models that work because they're small (fit on a screen or two), straightforward (involve basic math), clear (a non-MBA can follow them readily), and fast to build. These simple yet powerful representations of the cash flow for a new product/deal/venture help people share their vision, recognize tradeoffs, brainstorm</span><span class="deschide"> possibilities, and make decisions.</span><br />

This course first surveys the basics of fixed income: terminology, security types, debt and money markets. Attention then moves to the valuation of cash flows, term structure of interest rates and modeling of credit risk. Building on that foundation, the course then examines the key role that fixed income plays in the global financial system, other asset classes and derivatives. The course is firmly grounded in a quantitative and analytical approach, with each topic</span><span class="deschide"> placed in the relevant real world context -- for example, the role that high yield securities play in an LBO, and negotiation of bond covenants. The course is at the more quantitative end of the MBA curriculum, with a large focus on bond math, including duration and convexity.</span><br />

This course aims to improve the quality of decisions people make. Students learn to be aware of, and to avoid, common inferential errors and systematic biases in decision making. There are many decision traps that we tend to repeatedly fall into. These traps relate to how we think about risk and probability, how we learn from experience, and how we make choices. Upon completion, students will have internalized the basic principles of decision making and will be</span><span class="deschide"> able to avoid falling into these traps. The course additionally aims to create a deeper understanding of the psychology of decision making, which can create an advantage in negotiations and other interactions through gaining an awareness of the predictable mistakes of others.</span><br />

Many ethical and religious traditions advocate altruism and community-mindedness in all dealings, while some economic and financial theorists argue for a narrow focus on risk and reward, with little regard for the impact of decisions on stakeholder</span><span class="deschide"> groups or the environment.</span><br />

This course provides real world, hands-on learning on what it’s like to actually start a high-tech company. This class is not about how to write a business plan. It’s not an exercise on how smart you are in a classroom, or how well you use the research library to size markets. And the end result is not a PowerPoint slide deck for a VC presentation. And it is most definitely not an incubator where you come to build the “hot-idea” that you</span><span class="deschide"> have in mind. This is a practical class: Our goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create an entrepreneurial experience for you with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage start up.</span><br />

This course intends to help students apply the skills of applied innovation in a loosely-structured, open-ended project. Students will learn advanced techniques in the innovation process and apply it to a project of their choice. The course is loosely structured and includes a lot of coaching time with faculty, as well as feedback and critique time with peers. The course largely follows the innovation cycle — observe and notice, frame and reframe, imagine</span><span class="deschide"> and design, and make and test — but does so nonlinearly.</span><br />

Students learn about the key strategic choices that shape whether companies deliver real value to stakeholders. They are taught to organize the strategic choices into four different strategy “playbooks” that they can use to systematically consider alternate strategies for a startup, and the core elements needed to make these strategies work: Intellectual Property Strategy, Disruptive Strategy, Value Chain Strategy, and Architectural Strategy. Students must (a) analyze</span><span class="deschide"> cases, thinking systematically through what they would do if they were a founder or early-employee in the protagonists’ shoes; (b) engage in class discussions, treating the classroom as a laboratory; and (c) formulate a real strategic plan for a final strategy assignment.</span><br />
