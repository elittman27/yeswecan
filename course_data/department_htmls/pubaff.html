In this course, we are going to study the use of research methods, statistics, and probability theory in public decision making. We will begin with case studies of important public policy topics where key decisions depend on the interpretation of results from empirical research or on probabilistic assessments of the likelihood of various outcomes. We will then study the basics</span><span class="deschide"> of probability theory, statistical sampling, hypothesis testing, and inferring causality.</span><br/>

There is increasing emphasis throughout the public and non-profit sectors to invest in practices that are “evidence based&quot;. In this course, we are going to study the role of empirical research in public decision making and the common research strategies employed to study problems of causal inference and prediction. The effectiveness of specific intervention often relies on research attempting to demonstrate</span><span class="deschide"> that one variable (for example, a particular educational intervention) has a causal effect on an outcome of interest (for example, successful completion of high school).
