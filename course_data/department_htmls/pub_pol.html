This course introduces a range of economic phenomena that cannot be explained by standard, fully rational economic models, and explores implications for public policy. Why do we vote for social security despite the fact that it reduces our freedom to choose how we spend our money? What would happen to job seeking behavior if we cut off unemployment benefits in multiple steps? Why do fines work better than bonuses (except when they don't)? What</span><span class="deschide"> kinds of policies should the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implement? Behavioral Economics provides answers to these questions that standard economics does not.<br/></span><br />

The class focuses on the economic regulation of electricity and natural gas and its role in public policy innovation. We will explore the regulatory rationale in the context of microeconomic principles, the nature and evolution of energy technology and regulation in the United States, and the ways to advance public policy objectives. The class covers the alternatives to traditional cost-of-service rate regulation, the electricity deregulation</span><span class="deschide"> experiment, the resulting energy crisis in California, and current efforts to reconsider the utility business model. We will delve into how the economic regulatory framework creates opportunities to implement public policy, and the enhanced role climate change now plays in decision making worldwide.</span><br />

In this interdisciplinary course students examine the relationships among social science, law, and crime prevention policy. Emphasis is placed on how psychological science (clinical, developmental, social) can inform decisions about individuals at high risk for repeated involvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Topics of focus include risk assessment, adolescent development and juvenile justice, and prevention/intervention/correctional</span><span class="deschide"> psychology. Students will have an opportunity to master a specific problem area. Broadly, goals are for students to a) become comfortable in translating crime prevention problems into social scientific questions, and b) specifically understand how research findings can inform law and policy.</span><br />

This course focuses on the art and science of public</span><span class="deschide"> policy analysis. We address the following fundamental questions: What kinds of problems are public problems? How do we know when government should get involved? What kinds of solutions are available to government? How do we confront the trade-offs between possible solutions?</span><br />

Third, we will examine the role of individual and collective healing focusing on the principles of restorative justice.

The goal of the course is to understand the cause and structure of a broad set of global challenges, with an eye towards eventually participating in their management or resolution. The first part provides foundations for understanding the governance context in which global challenges emerge. The second</span><span class="deschide"> part of the course examines individual topic areas, building students’ knowledge of modern issues and policy debates.

The course provides students an in-depth understanding of key issues and constraints facing top officials in running a city. The course examines the extent cities are viable: can they provide services residents demand and deserve; can they provide for public safety, jobs, housing, schools, basic services, and fill potholes? And there is the public interest question: viable for whom and in benefit of whom? Using Oakland and Bay Area cities as case studies</span><span class="deschide">, the course integrates direct front-line experience with broader conceptual analyses. Students work on projects of current importance and gain familiarity with a wide-range of city policies and programs. The class will include presentations by key city decision-makers.</span><br />

reasons for engaging in rebellion. Why do people fight? The second unit turns to the internal dynamics of conflict. How are civilians treated during the war? Why do rebels and civilians<br/>
cooperate? The third unit explores conflict resolution and post-war politics, where</span><span class="deschide"> we explore issues of peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and post-war reconstruction. In the end, students<br/>

This course covers intermediate quantitative methods for public policy analysis. The primary learning goals for the course are that students understand how to 1) implement and interpret linear regression; 2) distinguish correlation from causation; 3) code descriptive statistics, regressions, and data visualizations; and 4) engage in self-learning of additional methods depending on the student’s research interests. We will also learn, in a mostly conceptual way, about</span><span class="deschide"> more advanced linear models and ‘quasi-experimental’ research design such that students leave the course as effective consumers of these methods.</span><br />

How do we know whether a program or policy is having its intended impact? This course will cover the methods used to answer this question. The focus will be on quantitative studies, with an emphasis on the econometric techniques used in experimental and non-experimental evaluations.

This class examines the racist history of public policy in the U.S. and teaches students to use radical imagination to inspire new policy ideas for a transformative social change. We will explore how the legacy of stolen land and human bondage persist in exclusionary government policies that generate, maintain, and enforce inequitable systems. We will learn from advocates, researchers, and practitioners engaged in the collective process of radical</span><span class="deschide"> imagination across a wide range of social spheres. Students will come to understand how policies can contribute to or mitigate the interlocking and mutually reinforcing nature of racism and anti-Blackness and will begin to envision policies towards building a thriving multiracial democracy.</span><br />

This seminar brings together two related frames for policy thinking: the ethics of policy, that is, what does it mean to do the right thing? and the intervention of policy, that is, how do new policy paradigms emerge? Those who seek to govern well inescapably confront questions of value in their political, professional, and personal choices. the discussion of ethical dilemmas, which will take up the first half of the semester, is designed to</span><span class="deschide"> provoke analytic reflection on the moral challenges and responsibilities of public policymaking in a democracy. The focus is on the many and often competing obligations, commitments and values that should guide public actors, as well as on the public principles that guide the design of good public policy. <big ideas:=""> Politics and conventional analytics dominate policy in the short run. But over the longer term, conceptualizations as varied as exit/voice/loyalty, satisficing, the tipping point, memes, winner-take-all, strong democracy, broken windows, and the prisoners dilemma profoundly influence the policy conservation.</big></span><br />

This course will focus on the evolution and current status of renewable energy policy on the federal, state, and local levels. It will explore the context for promoting renewables in a country that has long subsidized fossil production and nuclear power and encouraged greater consumption. We will explore the particular tools and perspectives that governments on different levels bring to the challenge and the ways various governmental bodies have</span><span class="deschide"> seized that opportunity. We will move beyond consideration of broad policies to examine the specific policy challenges and opportunities faced by proponents of each of the major renewable energy technologies.</span><br />

This Clinic seeks to develop students to advance an anti-racist future guided by the principles of love, healing, and justice. Students are required to enroll in the companion theory course, EnvDes C231, Critical Race Theory in Planning, Design, and Public Policy. This Clinic focuses on four areas of professional practice. First, students are supervised by experienced professional practitioners. Second, students will learn the framework of racial equity</span><span class="deschide"> analysis through applied theoretical frameworks and case study pedagogy. Third, students will apply the framework of racial equity analysis to real-world projects.
