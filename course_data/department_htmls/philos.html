This course is an introduction to key issues in feminist philosophy. The first part of the course focuses on building up a toolbox of important feminist concepts. In the second unit of the course, we will consider several major approaches to thinking about sex- and gender-based oppression. Finally, we will bring our knowledge of those approaches to bear on a number of special topics. Throughout the course</span><span class="deschide">, we will focus on the ways in which questions about the nature, status, rights, and abilities of women intersect with questions about race, class, sexuality, coloniality, and disability.</span><br />

Intended as a first course in logic for students with no previous exposure to the subject, the course treats symbolic logic. Students will learn to formalize reasoning in symbolic languages with precisely defined meanings and rules of inference. Symbolic logic is by nature a mathematical subject, but the course does not presuppose any prior coursework in mathematics—only an openness to mathematical</span><span class="deschide"> reasoning.<br/>
The course concentrates on three systems of symbolic logic: propositional logic (or sentential logic); syllogistic logic; and predicate logic (or first-order logic). Students from philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics will find important connections between symbolic logic and their other coursework.</span><br />

A tour of metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical issues raised by AI examining questions like: What is intelligence? What is agency? How do we know if machines have either of these? What’s the difference between an AI making predictions, yielding explanations, and understanding? What exactly would it take for a machine to understand natural language as human beings do? On the ethical side, questions like: If an algorithm manifests biased behavior, whose fault</span><span class="deschide"> is it? How applications of AI threaten privacy or manipulate? Do basic questions of morality need to be settled so that we can program autonomous robots and vehicles?

This course is an introduction to various philosophical issues which arise in physics, concerning the nature of motion, laws, forces, space, time, and probability. The first half of the course will be concerned with classical mechanics; the second half will introduce special relativity and quantum mechanics. Questions to be discussed include: Are there instantaneous velocities? Are the laws of physics true, or are they just predictively useful approximations?</span><span class="deschide"> Are forces like gravity real, or are they just mathematically convenient fictions? Is Newtonian mechanics really deterministic? Is space a thing (and what would that even mean)? What makes time different from space? In what sense does time have a direction?

Science is often regarded as preeminently rational. Yet recent work in philosophy, history and sociology of science suggests that scientific knowledge is no more rationally established than other sorts of knowledge, and that scientists' convictions are driven more by party loyalty and ego than by a pureminded pursuit of truth.

The philosophy of perception is a microcosm of the metaphysics of mind. Its central problems - What is perception? What is the nature of perceptual consciousness? How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? - are problems at the heart of metaphysics.

Individuals in a group often have conflicting preferences between alternative courses of action, e.g., concerning the choice of a leader for the group, the choice of public policies,<br/>
and so on. Moreover, actions often affect individuals differently: some may gain while others may lose, and the magnitudes of gains and losses may be unequal for different individuals.<br/>
These observations lead to two of the basic questions of Social Choice Theory. First, what</span><span class="deschide"> are good methods of group decision making in the face of conflicting preferences? Second, can we evaluate the overall social welfare of some alternative course of action in terms of the welfare of each individual in the group under that alternative?</span><br />

This is an introduction to Buddhist philosophy, extending from its origins (as preserved in the early sūtra literature), down through its evolution into multiple competing philosophical traditions (Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, Yogācāra, Pramāṇavāda, and so on). We will explore Buddhist approaches to issues in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, language, and ethics. One theme running through the course will be radical skepticism; we will explore how Buddhist philosophers</span><span class="deschide"> questioned not only the existence of an enduring or essential self but also the existence of an external (mind-independent) world, and how their analyses impacted their understandings of meaning in language, their accounts of the nature and function of consciousness.</span><br />

In this course, we will trace the development of Heidegger’s philosophical work from his early attempt to work out a “fundamental ontology” to his late projects of formulating a “history of Being” and of elaborating a new, “poetic” way of thinking. Based on close readings of selected texts including *Being and Time*, *The Origin of the Work of Art*, and “The Question Concerning Technology,” we will analyze key concepts</span><span class="deschide"> such as “Being” and “beings,” “temporality” and “historicity,” or “enowning” and“enframing.” Led by these texts, we will explore how Heidegger seeks to reconceive subjectivity,intersubjectivity, cognition, and language by dissociating his own approach from the philosophical tradition.</span><br />
