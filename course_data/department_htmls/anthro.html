This course explores the dramatic developments in human evolution, behavior and culture that accompany the emergence of prehistoric human society, from our earliest Palaeolithic ancestors who first ventured out of Africa over a million years ago to the origins of settled farming economies and the first urban environments.

Bioarchaeology is the study of archaeological human skeletal remains together with contextual information (archival, historical, material culture) to provide insight on the life of people and communities in the past. In this course you will delve into the formative contemporary literature and get to work with actual archaeological skeletal remains in order to learn bioarchaeological methods, develop your own research questions, and conduct</span><span class="deschide"> and complete a hands-on research project. You will work with skeletal remains from the stage of identification, inventory, illustration/photography, to the collection of data such as sex, age, stature, and health/growth, pathology, and statistical analysis.</span><br />

In the contemporary world, different systems of knowledge, philosophies, and techniques of the self, understandings of normality and pathology, illness and healing, are increasingly engaged in a dialogue with each other in the lives, on the bodies, and in the imagination of people. The terms of this dialogue are often unequal and painful, yet they are also productive of new subjectivities and new voices. It is the task of a renewed psychological</span><span class="deschide"> anthropology to study and reflect on these processes. Topics to be covered in this class include new forms of the subject and ethics at the intersection of psychical/psychiatric, political, and religious processes and discources; ethno-psychiatry, psychoanalysis, the psychology of colonization and racism; anthropological approaches to possession and altered states, emotion, culture, and the imagination, madness and mental illness. The specific stress will be on the stakes of anthropology of the psyche today, for an understanding of power and subjugation, delusion and the imagination, violence, and the possibility of new forms of life.</span><br />

Modern times have been dominated by utopian visions of how to achieve a happy future society. Artists in competing social systems played a central role in the development of these visions.

Disability is a cultural construct. This does not mean that physical and mental impairments are not real, but that our conceptions of the body and its possibilities and impossibilities are constantly mediated through social norms and mores. The built environments and social institutions we navigate are based around these concepts of the “normal.” Using ethnographic examples drawn from various countries around the world, and various disability</span><span class="deschide"> categories, we examine the contingency of the categories of disability and normality from social, legal, and personal perspectives.</span><br />

This course provides an advanced introduction to key conceptual work in the anthropology of science, technology, and knowledge production. The course examines how truth-effects are produced in the world, and how people know what we know. It explores the social and political arrangements “built into” or materialized through the infrastructures and objects that help structure lives in the U.S. and globally. It asks how new information technology, media platforms, and</span><span class="deschide"> data-rich practices change the questions of knowledge and truth. It examines such things as life by algorithm, data mining, the self-tracking movement (especially vis-à-vis health), and the infrastructures of “the cloud”.</span><br />

This course highlights Southeast Asia as an important region for the study of politics and power from an anthropological perspective. It sheds light on how notions of “power” stemming from the unique political histories of Southeast Asia might help us rethink its role in governmentality, knowledge-producing practices, and in creating the conditions for political legitimacy. We will examine how various forces shaped what power came to be in</span><span class="deschide"> time and place. We will examine how this legacy continues in terms of patron-client networks, the meaning of political legitimacy, and ways of seeing sex and gender.</span><br />
