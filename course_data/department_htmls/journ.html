As the costs of our industrialized food system become impossible to ignore, a national debate over the future of food and farming has begun. Telling stories about where food comes from, how it is produced (and might be produced differently) plays a critical role in bringing attention to the issues and shifting politics. Each week a prominent figure in this debate explores what can be done to make the food system healthier more equitable, more sustainable, and the role</span><span class="deschide"> of storytelling in the process.</span><br />

What’s it like to tell stories using a variety of different media? Competence in the use of new journalistic tools and the skill to shape content for rapidly changing formats are both essential for any communicator in the 21st century. This intensive introductory course is designed to teach foundational skills for students who have minimal or no experience in creating multimedia news packages. Using</span><span class="deschide"> lectures, readings, discussions, guest speakers, and field work, we will guide students through an exploration of the elements and forms of multimedia storytelling, and teach skills in news gathering and story production. This course is part of minor program which has been approved for fall &amp; spring.</span><br />

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The objective of this course is to train all students—regardless of their planned area of specialty—to grasp foundational skills that can be applied to many types of storytelling. Using case studies, instructors will teach how to – and how not to -- create, organize and manage multimedia news packages. Students will learn how to choose which medium — video, audio, still photography, graphics or text — best suits the particular type of story or different segments of a story they wish to tell. By the conclusion of the course students will have developed basic skills in choosing stories, shooting video and still images with a mobile device, writing accompanying text, and editing their work by laptop into finished story packages. Importantly, students will also learn how to apply core journalistic values and the highest professional standards to their multimedia work. A required final project presents students the opportunity to apply their learning.</p></div>

This course introduces students to the workflows and techniques for journalistic reporting using data. In many traditional forms of journalism, reporters rely mostly on interviews and anecdotes to create stories. But in a world filled with misinformation—where the very foundations of trust have been shaken—audiences expect more. This course will cover using data for both research</span><span class="deschide"> and reporting, as well as communicating stories with data. Data has become ubiquitous and accessible in recent years. Data analysis skills are now part of the standard repertoire for many journalists. By its nature, data is based on evidence and observations. But like all evidence, it needs context and interpretation.<br/>

Media Ethics will concentrate on ethical dilemmas faced by reporters and editors. Using case studies, readings and guest lecturers, the course examines the murkier conflicts that don't necessarily make it to court but nevertheless force difficult newsroom decision-making. What should journalists do? How should they justify their decisions? This course examines key ethical questions facing journalists, many of which took root in a pre-digital</span><span class="deschide"> era. The central premise of this course is that journalism has the capacity to challenge social injustice, which is one reason to participate in and protect the profession. At the same time, dominant journalism has regularly dehumanized marginalized communities.</span><br />

Mass incarceration has affected all of our lives. It costs $55,000 per year to incarcerate a man in a California prison. In the 1960s, tuition was free. There were fewer than 25,000 inmates and eight prisons. Now, there are more than 33 prisons and 115,000 inmates. Tuition for California residents is more than $15,000 at UC. This course will bring UC Berkeley students into a classroom setting inside a prison where their classmates will be graduates</span><span class="deschide"> of Mt.

It can take a lifetime of writing to learn how to critique and revise your work. Hard as writing can be, rewriting -- breaking back into your own framework, rethinking, re-imagining, and revising -- can be harder yet. Sometimes only an editor can help you gain the distance needed to view your work.
