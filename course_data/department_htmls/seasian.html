The eleven nation-states that comprise the region of Southeast Asia are defined by their linguistic, cultural, economic, and sociopolitical diversity. One facet that plays a crucial role in binding this region is its environment. In order to explore both how the natural world has shaped the history of Southeast Asia and how the human relationship to the environment has changed over time, this course takes as its focus an examination of how “nature” or the environment</span><span class="deschide"> in Southeast Asia has been and is being represented through various forms of visual culture. Each week we will focus our inquiry on a different theme including: the history of Hindu/Buddhist temple architecture and the arrival of Islam and its impact on visual representation.</span><br />

Together we will read and view a variety of stories—told primarily in the form of prose fiction, poetry, essays, films and other visual art—by Vietnamese and overseas Vietnamese writers and artists who explore the consequences of colonialism, war, migration and resettlement for individuals, families and communities using vastly different aesthetic techniques and registering multiple social, cultural, political and personal concerns. We will attend especially to</span><span class="deschide"> the ways in which war and postwar generation artists and writers define and refine what it means to be Vietnamese and diasporic Vietnamese in changing local, regional and global contexts, and how the past and present continue to be intertwined in our lives and narratives.</span><br />

This Upper Division, seminar-style class introduces students to the modern history and politics of Southeast Asia, from the 1940s to the 2010s, through the lens of cinema and the frame of memory. From American B-Movies to Japanese anti-war features, media monarchs to Indie film-makers, spectral spouses to exorcist monks, Cambodian Claymation to Indonesia film noir, we explore cinema as a vehicle of propaganda, remembrance, experimentation, repression, expression and</span><span class="deschide"> resistance – but most of all, as a theater of memory.</span><br />

This course offers an advanced introduction to the literary history, cultural norms,<br/>
poetic forms and textual traditions of 17 th  to 19 th  century Southeast Asia through a<br/>
comparative study of three epic poems:  Tum Teav (Cambodia), Khun Chang Khun<br/>
Phaen (Thailand), and Tale of Kieu (Vietnam).  We will explore the dynamics of desire<br/>
and transgression, duty and sacrifice, kinship and kingship, and the interplay between<br/>
folk, court, Buddhist</span><span class="deschide">, Confucian, and Hindu values.  Finally, we will consider the<br/>
contemporary currency and iconic status of these works in Southeast Asia and in<br/>
diaspora; what makes a national canon, and why these epic tales of love, loss and war,<br/>
remain strangers to the west.</span><br />
