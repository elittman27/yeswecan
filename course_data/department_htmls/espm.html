The course presents a diachronic perspective on human-fire interactions with local ecosystems in California that spans over 10,000 years. The course will provide an historical perspective on human-fire interactions at the landscape scale using a diverse range of data sources drawn from the fields of fire ecology, biology, history, anthropology, and archaeology. An important component includes examining how diverse cultures and ethnicity influenced</span><span class="deschide"> how people perceived and used fire at the landscape scale in ancient, historical and modern times. The implications of these diverse fire practices and policies will be analyzed and the consequences they have had for transforming habitats and propagating catastrophic fires will be explored.</span><br />

From interactive web maps to spatial data analysis, digital geographic data and information are becoming an important part of the data science landscape. Almost everything happens somewhere that can be mapped on the surface of the earth. In many cases the where matters as much to an analysis as the what and the why. Geospatial data analysis allows a researcher to consider location explicitly. This course provides an introduction to working with digital</span><span class="deschide"> geographic data, or geospatial data. We will explore concepts of geospatial data representation, methods for acquisition, processing and analysis, and techniques for creating compelling geovisualizations.

Human societies have significant knowledge about environmental and social problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and chemical pollution, as well as the underlying causes. We have a growing sense of what could be done to make societies more sustainable and just. Yet there appear to be many obstacles and much inertia in progressing towards implementing deeper changes in complex social and economic systems, from the</span><span class="deschide"> food system to chemical manufacturing to urban transportation.

This course focuses on natural factors of the environment that are fundamental to ecosystem management, land use planning and landscape design and their relationships to one another in different terrestrial ecosystems, from predominantly natural to predominantly anthropogenic. Lectures explore the key concepts on ecosystem structure, function and dynamics and discuss different types of ecological data, their interpretation and visualization that</span><span class="deschide"> can aid in landscape research, planning and design workflow. Laboratory sections advance lecture topics by providing hands-on training in common types of ecosystem analyses using quantitative methods and geospatial tools.</span><br />

This course will introduce students to the study and management of soils as natural bodies, as media for plant<br/>
growth and as integral components of terrestrial ecosystems. It will present basic concepts of soil science<br/>
including: soil formation and classification, the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils, the role of<br/>
soil in supplying water and nutrients to plants and soil organisms, as well as applications</span><span class="deschide"> of soil concepts in<br/>
farming or engineering. The course will also introduce the relationships of soils to environmental problems.</span><br />

This course examines the centrality of gender and intersectionality in understanding nature-society relations across time and space. During the first half of the semester, students will become familiar with key feminist theoretical approaches to studying environmental problems, including ecofeminism, feminist environmentalism, feminist critiques of science, feminist political ecology, and queer and more-than-human ecologies. In the remainder</span><span class="deschide"> of the semester, students will apply the theories learned to explore contemporary feminist environmental movements and analyze key topics, such as resource politics, pollution and toxins, environmental and reproductive justice, climate change, and the ethics of care.</span><br />

This course centers the body as a key analytic to understanding the more-than-human world. The sick, injured, and disabled body is a central and reoccurring theme within environmental scholarship, as is its opposite, the healthy, robust, and fit body. In this class we will explore the sociopolitical and ethical relationships between altered bodily capacity, vulnerability, dependency, and systems of violence to nature and people, while attending to the sometimes troubling</span><span class="deschide"> ways conversations around ecological health and fitness are informed by social inequality</span><br />

Society and the natural environment are vitally linked in a number of ways. Environmental<br/>
problems such as pollution and natural resource depletion are not only problems for society,<br/>
affecting the way we live our lives; they are also problems of society—the result of patterns of<br/>
social organization and social practices. In this course we will explore some various issues,<br/>

Ecology is a scientific discipline that focuses on the interactions between organisms and their<br/>
environment. This class will provide an overview of core concepts and applications, and will also provide practice with writing, small-group work, critical thinking, and data analysis.<br/>
The class will specifically cover principles of population ecology, illustrated with examples from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. It will</span><span class="deschide"> consider the roles of physical and biological processes in structuring natural communities. Observational, experimental, and theoretical approaches will be discussed.

Animals have long been the subject of human inquiry. As historian Harriet Ritvo writes, “Learned attention to the animal is far from new.&quot; However, in recent decades social movements, artists, and scholars have focused more frequently, and perhaps more urgently, on what Derrida called “the question of the animal.” In this course we will look to how centering the animal challenges human exceptionalism, anthropocentrism, and traditional critical discourse. Tracing</span><span class="deschide"> the ways work in animal studies denaturalizes hierarchical taxonomies, defines key concepts such as human and animal, and articulates boundaries between species, this course will follow the various political, relational, ethical and imaginative implications of thinking with animals.</span><br />

The purpose of the course is to provide students with basic knowledge of how to plan for and conduct forest treatments. It is meant as a companion to silviculture, which is the planning out and scheduling of treatments in order to meet defined objectives in forests. As such, Forest Operations does not focus on the reason for conducting treatments but rather how they are done. Topics include the types of equipment that are used in thinning, harvesting</span><span class="deschide">, prescribed fire, and vegetation management. The administrative requirements involved with planning operations (e.g. permit acquisition and contracts) are covered, as are principles of road maintenance and road abandonment.

We will also discuss how such interactions lead to rapid evolutionary</span><span class="deschide"> change in cities and discuss what that means for urban biodiversity and conservation. Finally, we will address how cities regionally and globally have similar and dissimilar properties, and how we can apply urban ecological principles to urban planning, design, conservation, wildlife manage.</span><br />

The objective of the course is to explore major topics in animal communication. Topics each year will focus on a different sensory modality and range from visual, acoustic, and chemical senses. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the study of communication, over the course of the semester, we will draw on a variety of disciplines (including cell biology, ecology, evolution, genetics, neurophysiology, and physics) to understand the mechanisms</span><span class="deschide">, function, and evolution of communication.</span><br />

At the core of successful research and resource management with Indigenous peoples is the ability to work collaboratively, reflexively, and responsively.</span><br />

Writing is one of the most compelling skills we learn as environmental scientists and communicators.
