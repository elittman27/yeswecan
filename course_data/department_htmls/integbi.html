Bioinspired design views the process of how we learn from Nature as an innovation strategy translating principles of function, performance and aesthetics from biology to human technology. The creative design process is driven by interdisciplinary exchange among engineering, biology, art, architecture and business. Diverse teams of students will collaborate on, create, and present original bioinspired design projects. Lectures discuss biomimicry</span><span class="deschide">, challenges of extracting principles from Nature, scaling, robustness, and entrepreneurship through case studies highlighting robots that run, fly, and swim, materials like gecko-inspired adhesives, artificial muscles, medical prosthetic devices, and translation to start-ups.</span><br />

We live in a microbial world, and the evolution of multicellular organisms has been intimately affected by microbes. Their influences range from mutualistic benefits to disease and represent a fundamental force that shapes plant and animal phenotypes and evolutionary trajectories.

Many of the challenges of managing infectious disease are essentially ecological and evolutionary problems. Disease follows the rules of species interactions as it spreads through host populations while resistance to antibiotics occurs through the rules of evolutionary biology.

This course is an in-depth look at the biology of form and function. We will examine anatomy and compare features among fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals (including humans) to understand how structures develop, how they have evolved, and how they interact with one another to allow animals to live in a variety of environments. We will study the integration of the skeletal, muscular, nervous, vascular, respiratory, digestive, endocrine</span><span class="deschide">, and urogenital systems to explore the historical and present diversity of vertebrate animals.</span><br />

The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a broad understanding of the evolution of hormonal systems. A comparative approach allows us to envisage how the complex mammalian endocrine system presumably evolved from that of more primitive vertebrates. Students will learn about endocrine pathways and endocrine-based behaviors of jawless fishes, fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals. In addition, students will gain</span><span class="deschide"> an understanding of the experimental methods used in endocrine research. The class teaches students how to read and interpret the primary scientific literature; thus it encourages the critical thinking that is a fundamental skill for any scientist.</span><br />

This course is designed to be an interdisciplinary course. It will adopt a broad-based approach to explore the concepts of stress, health, and disease, with a particular focus on current primary literature.

Neuroethologists study neural systems by combining behavior and neuroscience to understand the neural mechanism that have evolved in various animals to solve particular problems encountered in their environmental niches. This comparative approach that emphasizes how information is processed and transformed by the brain is particularly powerful for understanding neural systems. In this course, you will learn important concepts in ethology</span><span class="deschide">, sensory systems, motor systems and neural plasticity and development by studying the behavior and brains of animals such as crickets, lobsters, barn-owls, honey-bees, echolocating bats, electric fishes and songbirds.</span><br />

Evolutionary physiology studies how physiological traits arise and are modified during adaptation to the environment. An integrative understanding of the origin and maintenance of physiological traits, encompassing levels of biological hierarchy from molecular to ecological and biogeographic, is essential for improving human health and stewarding the natural world through the current era of rapid environmental change. This course consists</span><span class="deschide"> of three parts: 1) big questions in evolutionary physiology and how they are addressed; 2) a student-led exploration of how environmental factors have shaped physiological evolution; and 3) predicting responses to global change using evolutionary physiology.</span><br />

The biological world is shaped by interactions among species. These inter-specific interactions, such as between predators and prey, plants and pollinators, or hosts and pathogens, have led to an impressive array of adaptations, helping to explain the incredible organismal and genetic diversity on Earth. Our understanding of coevolution (the responses to reciprocal selection acting on two interacting populations) has been greatly facilitated</span><span class="deschide"> in the last few years by conceptual advancements, new methods allowing direct tests of theory, next generation sequencing technology, and the advance of ‘omics’ approaches.</span><br />

Did you know that our closest living fish relative can build a cocoon and hibernate for three years? Or that some fish make a living by eating scales? This class will conduct publishable research in evolution, ecology, and behavior by doing actual science on fishes.

The primary focus throughout the semester will be on independent group projects conducting laboratory and field experiments testing hypotheses about our focal fish groups: scale-eating pupfish, sponge-eating cichlids, cocoon-building lungfish, Monterey kelp forest communities, and four-eyed fishes. By focusing on these diverse study systems, students will receive a broad perspective on how to investigate and test hypotheses about adaptation in the field and lab. The class will include three field trips, high-speed video of prey capture, and detailed studies of behavior, ecology, and functional morphology.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be taught how to generate original hypotheses, collect and analyze data in the R statistical programming language, discuss scientific literature, present their research, and publish their results. Students will ask their own independent research questions and conduct experiments to answer them. Lecture topics will focus on the evolution, ecology, behavior, anatomy, and biodiversity of fishes, with an introduction to concepts including adaptationism, natural selection, convergent evolution, exaptation, tree thinking, evolutionary novelty, behavioral ecology, applications to human health, and conservation.</p></div>

This course provides undergraduate students with direct, hands-on experience with pedagogical practices in a laboratory course setting. Many students seek opportunities to continue participating in laboratory courses that they have already completed due to an interest in the topic and a desire to engage in the process of biological instruction. This course allows qualified undergraduates to gain direct experience with instruction of lab courses</span><span class="deschide"> in a structured, mentored, and pedagogically informed setting. Each student in the course will be paired with a Graduate Student Instructor who will provide near-peer mentoring regarding classroom practices and development of pedagogical practices.</span><br />

This graduate seminar consists of weekly presentations from Berkeley graduate students as well as outside speakers on topics surrounding evolution, genetics, and genomics. Many labs spread across different departments have research programs focused on evolution, genetics, and genomics. However, it can be challenging to keep abreast of this research and to identify potential collaborations due to the dispersion of labs across different departments</span><span class="deschide"> and specialties. The Center for Theoretical and Evolutionary Genetics (CTEG) is an informal group of labs that collectively work on genetics and genomics. The seminar seeks to provide a common space for graduate students to present their research and learn about the research of their colleagues.</span><br />
