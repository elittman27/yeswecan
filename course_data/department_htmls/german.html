How do we know what the “moral” of a story is? We will focus on three biblical narratives that have frequently been interpreted as teaching moral lessons: the story of Job, the story of Abraham and the binding of Isaac, and the story of Moses giving the law. These stories have been interpreted variously in moral terms--e.g. as demonstrating the virtues of faith, obedience, mercy, and forgiveness, and as teaching us about guilt, punishment, reward, and</span><span class="deschide"> human frailty. They have also been analyzed as existential parables, psychological dramas, and political allegories. The goal of this class is to examine how a range of different, and often provocative, interpretations of these stories’ moral lessons rest on particular ways of reading.</span><br />

This capstone project is designed to allow students to “finish off” their German majors in such a way as to return to, develop, and synthesize what they have learned in the major.

This is not an Honors Thesis, which requires students to develop an independent project and engage in solo research in order to produce an original</span><span class="deschide"> 30-page paper.</span><br />

In the light of recent calls to “decolonize the university,” this course will stimulate<br/>
students to question assumptions about collective identities by thinking comparatively<br/>
across space and time, considering the role that migration has played in the cultural<br/>
formation of societies. Enduring structures of racial hierarchy that underpin social<br/>
organization and representation will be at the center of critical analysis. Focusing</span><span class="deschide"> both on<br/>
movement and entrapment, the materials and the pedagogical approaches employed<br/>

“Meditate that this came about: I command these words to you,” writes the Holocaust survivor and author Primo Levi. Taking seriously Levi’s dictum, this comparative course explores the ways in which the Holocaust has been represented in different media, including literature, film, and televisual narratives. To explore the political, aesthetic, and ethical dimensions of remembering the Nazi genocide, the course engages with a wide range of both documentary and fictional</span><span class="deschide"> genres, such as diaries, memoirs, lyric poetry, novels, home videos and feature films. Emphasis will be both on formal features and medial possibilities of representing the Shoah and their historical evolution since the end of World War II.</span><br />

The history of Germany's first parliamentary democracy is a dramatic one, dominated by economic woes, political violence, and a general perception of crisis and decline.

This course introduces principal figures from the basic disciplines of philosophy, biology, and linguistics who are particularly influential in current trends in semiotic method.

This course will explore how experiences of migration, dislocation, or exile are visualized in cinema, and how processes of internationalization in film production and distribution intersect with the projection of a transnational global imagery. Some examples of transnational cinematic connections will be analyzed in historical perspective as well as contemporary examples of &quot;migrant cinema.&quot; We will investigate how these films engage</span><span class="deschide"> with debates about multiculturalism and assimilation/segregation of minorities, as scenarios of itinerancy and mobility are often intertwined with representations of ethnicity and gender.</span><br />

Broadly defined as the period from 1750 to 1900 – through the lens of current theoretical concerns and the latest criticism. Departing from traditional schemes of periodization (Enlightenment, Classicism, Romanticism, Realism etc.) as well as from conventional analytical categories, we will revisit some of the most seminal texts in German literature as test cases for alternative historical narratives and new critical idioms. Canonical texts prove to be open to entirely</span><span class="deschide"> new readings in light of contemporary theory. Conversely, they also help us elaborate, revise, and perhaps move beyond current theoretical paradigms. Critical texts are meant to showcase the state of the art and to inspire future research projects.<br/></span><br />

The seminar will focus on concentrated readings of selected passages from modernist German literature, ranging from Heinrich von Kleist, Robert Walser, Rainer Maria Rilke, Carl Einstein and Franz Kafka to Thomas Mann, Robert Musil, Ingeborg Bachmann, and Thomas Bernhard. Although the emphasis will be on fictional prose, we will also discuss theories of reading and modernist poetics. Our goals are to study the literary styles of modern German</span><span class="deschide"> writers and to practice reading skills that draw equally on aesthetics, rhetoric, literary theory, and media history. The teaching will be explorative, interactive, non-hierarchical, and collaborative.</span><br />

So-called ‘mystical’ forms of thought and experience have played a major role in the history of modern philosophy and literature from Hegel to Georg Lukàcs, Martin Heidegger, Georges Bataille, and Jacques Derrida, and from Novalis to Robert Musil, Paul Celan, Ingeborg Bachmann, Pierre Klossowski, and John Cage (to name just a few). In this seminar we will read and discuss key texts written by Eckhart of Hochheim (Meister Eckhart), Mechthild of</span><span class="deschide"> Magdeburg, and Hadewijch of Antwerp, some of the most significant medieval figures in this tradition.

Aesthetics is crucial to most of the humanities disciplines. This seminar studies the historical development as well as the key concerns of aesthetic theory from its eighteenth-century beginnings to the present day. The focus is on the classical age of aesthetics from Baumgarten to Nietzsche. We’ll first read the foundational texts by Kant, Schiller, the Romantics, and Hegel, among others. We then turn to the ramifications of, and challenges to, the theoretical</span><span class="deschide"> positions developed in the classical age, exploring the scientific, sociological, and media-theoretical discourse of aesthetics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as well as the interventions of major philosophers such as Heidegger and Adorno.</span><br />

This graduate seminar examines the field of media archaeology. While this burgeoning and somewhat amorphous field includes a plethora of approaches, it has been broadly shaped by an emphasis on heterogeneity, rupture, and discontinuity rather than singular origins, linear causality, and teleological progression; a deprivileging of realistic historical representation in favor of alternate, even counterfactual trajectories; an exploration of media practices beyond narrative</span><span class="deschide"> entertainment and theatrical exhibition. We will read foundational texts in the field alongside more recent interventions on a wide range of media, including paper, screens, sound, television, wireless, and virtual reality.</span><br />
