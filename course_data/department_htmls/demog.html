This course provides an accessible introduction to the social science of demography. The course is organized around cases in which population issues raise policy or ethical dilemmas (example: China's one child policy). Through these cases, students will learn how demographers use models and data to acquire knowledge about population. Throughout the course, students will also learn to read, interpret</span><span class="deschide">, evaluate, and produce tabular and graphical representations of population data.</span><br />

This course will cover the small but important part of the rich history human migration that deals with the population of the United<br/>
States--focusing on the 20th and 21st Centuries. We will use the tools of DS8 to answer specific questions that relate to the themes<br/>
of this course:<br/>
(1) Why do people migrate?<br/>
(2) Is immigration good or bad for receiving (and sending) countries?<br/>
(3) How do immigrants adapt and how do societies</span><span class="deschide"> change in response?<br/>
In addition to scientific questions, this course will also address the demographic and political history of immigration in the US --<br/>
an understanding  of which is crucial for understanding  both the broad contours of US history and the particular situation in which<br/>
we find ourselves today.<br/></span><br />

Despite our astonishing demographic success as a species, humans are haunted by the idea of apocalyptic demise. This course explores scientific and cultural narratives of population catastrophe particularly as presented in film. Noah's flood; nuclear annihilation; overpopulation; and climate change all raise the question: Does human nature carry within it the seeds of our inevitable destruction? In this course, we will grapple with both the science and</span><span class="deschide"> the art in which this question is embedded.</span><br />

The science of social networks focuses on measuring, modeling, and understanding the different ways that people are connected to one another. We will use a broad toolkit of theories and methods drawn from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to learn what a social network is, to understand how to work with social network data, and to illustrate some of the ways that social networks can be useful in theory and in</span><span class="deschide"> practice.
