This course is intended to introduce undergraduates to the study of a range of media, including photography, film, television, video, and print and digital media. The course will focus on questions of medium &quot;specificity&quot; or the key technological/material, formal and aesthetic features of different media and modes of address and representation that define them. Also considered is the relationship of individual</span><span class="deschide"> media to time and space, how individual media construct their audiences or spectators, and the kinds of looking or viewing they enable or encourage. The course will discuss the ideological effects of various media, particularly around questions of racial and sexual difference, national identity, capitalism, and power.</span><br />

Familiarizes the students with the major technological and aesthetic innovations of the past 80 years which have given rise to the cinema as we know it today.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Acquire a conceptual vocabulary to describe and analyze the formal strategies of films and the way they construct meaning.<br/>
Develop tools for analyzing the way film texts not only provide entertainment, but also produce cultural meanings and generate modes of experience (for example, of race, class, gender, sexuality, nation) and of social interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Foster students’ awareness of the aesthetic, economic, social and political contexts in which sound cinema developed and the impact which cinema had, in turn, on nations, cultures, and historical events.<br/>
Give students a clear sense of some of the major movements in sound cinema (including classical and post-classical Hollywood cinema, documentary, Italian Neo-Realism, the French New Wave, Third Cinema, Political Cinema of the 1960s-‘70s, and film in the era of global multimedia) and how those movements intertwined with critical, theoretical, and popular responses to the medium.<br/>

This course is a survey of the history and aesthetics of the international film Avant-Garde from the 1920s to the present. The course explores the development of a range of experimental film forms and practices, situating them in relation to the larger artistic, social, and intellectual contexts in which they arise. We look at the ways artists have not only created new film languages in order to express their unique ideas</span><span class="deschide"> and vision, but also how they inverted alternative modes of production, distribution, and exhibition for their work. We examine the major formal modes of Avant-Garde cinema, moving between historical and current developments.</span><br />

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course explores the international development of artist made, experimental and avant-garde film, electronic or new media practices. It looks at the ways artists have invented new formal languages in order to express their unique ideas and vision, and also how they have created alternative modes of production, distribution, and exhibition for their work. The course examines major movements in experimental and alternative media that exist outside of the constraints of industrial and mass media forms, as it at once critiques and expands dominant forms of media.<br />To broaden student awareness &amp; understanding of the history of experimental &amp; alternative film &amp; media practices that exist outside of the dominant film industry, including fine art practices that have emerged from the visual &amp; sonic arts rather than the dominant literary &amp; dramatic forms. To study underground &amp; marginal communities that have been under or unrepresented by the dominant film &amp; media industries. The course will also look beyond the artwork itself to explore the kinds of creative sub-cultures communities that this approach to art making has produced.<br/>
While emphasis on medium and technology may vary from year to year, depending on the instructor, conceptually, the course will always focus on film and media art as a form of personal and creative expression with a philosophical position that emphasizes process and invention over product and professional mastery.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Acquire a conceptual and aesthetic vocabulary necessary for the recognition and interpretation of experimental and alternative media practices in different media forms and technologies and to understand why experimental approaches to media practices have influenced, the dominant film and media world, the art world and academic film and media studies.<br/>
Acquire new informational content about the national/regional/global media landscape in question; with an emphasis on the role experimental film and media products play in the evolution of film and media language and form.<br/>
Develop the analytic skills necessary to interpret in a socio-historical and aesthetic context the art and media objects belonging to that area and learn about the cultural contexts in which those media practices are located.<br/>
Develop the research tools for advanced undergraduate writing on film and media in the area studied in the course.</p></div>

The second half of the</span><span class="deschide"> course explores the many forms of between-ness experienced by immigrants through intergenerational or transnational family conflicts; those displaced by war, the slave trade, or the Holocaust; and those confronting the relationship between personal and geopolitical histories of displacement.</span><br />

We explore the use and abuse of sound and its relation to image in cinema. With emphasis on how sound influences our emotional<br/>
reactions, we analyze dialogue, music and effects from the perspectives of the writer, the director, and the audience, looking at the<br/>
factors that guide and constrain the creative process, as well as how changes in presentation have affected audience response.<br/>
Examples are shown from foreign and domestic feature</span><span class="deschide">, documentary and animated films.</span><br />
