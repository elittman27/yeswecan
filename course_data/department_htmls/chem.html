<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> 1. Understand the principles of green chemistry and bio-inspired design and be able to apply them in<br/>
developing safer alternatives to a hazardous chemical or material in a specific application;<br/>
2. Understand principles of chemical exposure, hazard and risk and be able to apply them in the process of<br/>
evaluating alternatives to a chemical of concern;<br/>
3. Effectively access information and use tools to evaluate and compare the hazard profiles of chemicals<br/>
and materials;<br/>
4. Frame research questions and propose solutions, working in the applied setting of a partner company’s<br/>
challenge; and<br/>
5. Communicate complex technical ideas clearly and effectively in written and oral form.<br />This 4-unit interdisciplinary, project-based course is intended for undergraduate students in public health,<br/>
chemical engineering, chemistry, environmental studies, and engineering. The course draws on<br/>
students’ disciplinary expertise and teaches new skills to identify safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals<br/>
currently used in a product or manufacturing process</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Student teams complete interim assignments during the six-week, session-long research project, which<br/>
culminates in a final report and presentation. While class lectures, discussion and assignments support the<br/>
technical aspects of the project, significant emphasis is also placed on developing the requisite processoriented skills: gathering information, working in teams, and communicating effectively in both written and<br/>

After an introduction to the different aspects of our global energy consumption, the course will focus on the role of biomass. The course will illustrate how the global scale of energy guides the biomass research. Emphasis will be placed on the integration of the biological aspects (crop selection, harvesting, storage and distribution, and chemical composition of biomass) with the chemical aspects to convert biomass to energy.
