This course investigates the musical characteristics of human language. Major questions include: the relationship between musical and linguistic structures, such as tone, stress, and rhythm; the role of ethnomusicology in language study; how music and language are perceived and processed in the brain differently; and the acoustic properties of speech and music.</span><br />

This course is for people who want to learn a Native American language, understood to include any of the hundreds of indigenous languages of North, Central, and South America. Since most of these languages are not taught in the usual formal educational settings, a major emphasis of the course is helping students develop strategies for self-directed language learning and effective teaching methods to help others learn as well. The course will also provide</span><span class="deschide"> a basic introduction to principles of linguistic analysis that will make materials developed by specialists more accessible and useful to learners.<br/></span><br />

Introduction to linguistics, the study of language. The course includes sections on the study of speech sounds (phonetics),how those sounds are structured to form words (phonology), the structure of complex words (morphology),the structure of sentences (syntax),and the study of word meaning and how words combine to form propositions (semantics).We will also address common misperceptions about what language is and what it isn’t, including notions of</span><span class="deschide"> linguistic “correctness” and how different individuals use language (sociolinguistics),how languages are related to each other and change over time (historical linguistics), and how children learn languages (language acquisition).This course draws on data from languages all around the world.</span><br />

Everyone gestures – even when they might not realize it. This course seeks to uncover what we can learn about cognition and culture through the lens of this integral aspect of our communicative and cognitive selves. We will consider the relationship between language and gesture including its role in language acquisition and in signed languages, and study how gestures help us</span><span class="deschide"> communicate and help us think. We will also look at cross-cultural differences in gesture, the role of gesture in child development, applications of gesture from education to politics, and unpack the possibility of the gestural origins of human language.</span><br />

This class will explore phonological development, focusing primarily on first language acquisition. How do young children acquire the phonological and phonetic patterns of the language surrounding them? It is well-established that children exhibit pronunciation patterns that differ from those of adult speakers. We will examine a range of factors that might contribute to this: perceptual, articulatory, speech-planning, grammatical. In the last part of the</span><span class="deschide"> course we will briefly discuss phonological delays and second-language acquisition.

Even within a single language or dialect, speech can vary greatly. Variation occurs between groups, between individuals, and even within individuals in different contexts. The primary influence for such speech variation is social factors such as gender or class. While many differences can be found in word choice or sentence structure, most variability occurs in pronunciation. The study of social influences on pronunciation</span><span class="deschide"> is known as 'sociophonetics', an interface of the two subfield, sociolinguistics and phonetics.

This is a college level introduction to language creation and language study. Language creation lies somewhere between the realms of art and science, drawing heavily on both. Students will acquire the fundamentals of the scientific study of language, and will be encouraged to take that information and employ it creatively in the field of conlanging (language creation). This course will feature in class lectures, group discussion, classroom activities</span><span class="deschide">, and at home study.</span><br />

This course approaches writing as a cognitive activity, an attempt to translate ideas into written form which readers will understand. Creativity in writing, then, is cognitive creativity – including creative construction of reception. This approach to writing foregrounds linguistic framing as the means to reduce infinitely rich experience or concepts to finite communicative objects. We will employ Frame Semantics and Cognitive Metaphor Theory in analyzing and creating</span><span class="deschide"> written texts. The course examines a range of genres including popular media, academic writing, and poetry; student essays involve both creative text-building and self-reflection on their writing process.</span><br />

the study of language sounds, words, meanings, context, structure and change. This course<br/>
provides students with the computational skills necessary to analyze linguistic data from<br/>
these areas. We will draw on data from languages around the world and use computer<br/>

Construction grammar arose in cognitive linguistics from phenomena showing how thought structures language and how language also structures thought, and from grammatical phenomena that could not be accounted for by transformational grammars. Over the past three decades two major theoretical approaches have evolved: One based on embodied cognition results, conceptual metaphor, and the neural modeling of brain mechanisms necessary to account for thought and language;</span><span class="deschide"> and another theoretical approach that is disembodied, purely formal, and uses feature structures and head-driven grammars.

This course provides a graduate-level introduction to the relation of language and cognition, through the lens of computation. We will explore universal aspects of cognition that underlie language, and the effect of one's native language on cognition. We will do this by: (1) reading a mixture of classic and recent papers on these issues,(2) replicating or extending computational analyses in those papers,(3) identifying interesting questions</span><span class="deschide"> that are left open by the material covered, and (4) designing and conducting research to answer those open questions.</span><br />

This course is an introduction to the study of the linguistic and social phenomena that arise when speakers of different languages come in contact with one another, or when a community of speakers makes use of multiple languages. We will attend closely both to the grammatical dimensions of language contact processes and outcomes, and to the socio-historical and cultural conditions under which these processes take place. A major focus of the course will be to critically</span><span class="deschide"> examine the notion that language contact gives rise to a set of clearly distinguishable language types (pidgins, creoles, and mixed languages), as well as the notion that each of these types arise under determinate socio-historical conditions.</span><br />
