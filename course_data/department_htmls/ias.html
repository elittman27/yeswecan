This course is designed to expose both precollege and college level students to the issues, challenges, and skills needed to negotiate the global economic, social, political, and physical environment. It is an innovative and integrated approach to global studies pedagogy and leadership development. Students will be exposed to and trained in the fundamental concepts of globalization, global inequality</span><span class="deschide">, and global change. In addition to the general education provided by the core module of the course, each year the course will tackle a different theme that amplifies key issues in global studies. The course will link theory and analysis to the transformative forms of practice. Students will work in teams on a real-world project related to the course theme, thus developing valuable leadership skills. The faculty coordinator will be joined by experts both from within and outside the institution to bring to students lectures, presentations, experiential opportunities, workshops, and group projects to explore the concept of leadership, issues of human poverty, human rights, social justice, urban planning for sustainable growth, and development.</span><br />

The course will start with a brief introduction and evaluation of the scientific aspects behind climate change. Economic models will be developed to analyze the impacts of climate change and provide and critique existing and proposed policy tools. Specific topics studied are impacts on water resources and agriculture, economic evaluation of impacts, optimal control of greenhouse gases, benefit cost analysis, international treaty formation</span><span class="deschide">, discounting, uncertainty, irreversibility, and extreme events.</span><br />

This course is a self-contained introduction to the economics of climate change. Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments and equip them with the tools to participate</span><span class="deschide"> in discussions of climate change policy through an economic lens.</span><br />

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course will start with a brief review of the science of climate change, discuss scenarios of economic growth and the greenhouse gas emissions caused by economic activities and investigate various emission reduction opportunities and their economic costs. A significant amount of time will be spent on studying the impacts of climate change, their economic evaluation and how adaptation can lower the costs of climate damages.<br/>
<br />We will then study various theoretical frameworks economists have developed that answer the question how estimates about the costs and benefits of climate policy can be combined to find “good” climate policies. We then study three more specialized topics that turn out to be of great importance when analyzing climate change policy: first, how do we compare costs and benefits of generations that live many centuries apart? Second, how do we design climate policy when our projections of both the costs and the benefits of climate policy are highly uncertain? And third, how can equity considerations be accounted for in an economic assessment of climate change policy? The course will close with a look at international cooperation on climate policy and why it has been so difficult to agree on effective treatises that implement climate change policy.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building a simple integrated assessment model in Excel. They will be able to use that model to do simple analysis of climate change policy themselves.<br/>
Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change.</p></div>

This course is intended to prepare students from the various social science disciplines to be instructors in interdisciplinary/multi-departmental courses. It will serve as a forum to discuss problems and create innovative solutions to these problems. Focusing on course construction and operation, specialists from various disciplines will discuss strategies for moving outside of their areas of specialization and into broader areas of international</span><span class="deschide"> and area studies. Graduate students will be provided training in building their own interdisciplinary courses from the ground up.
