Spreadsheet financial models are often too big, complicated, and buggy to help people. In this course, students learn to design financial models that work because they're small (fit on a screen or two), straightforward (involve only basic math), clear (a non-MBA can follow them readily), and fast to build. These simple yet powerful representations of the cash flows for a new product/deal/venture help people share their vision, recognize tradeoffs</span><span class="deschide">, brainstorm possibilities, and make decisions.</span><br />

This course first surveys the basics of fixed income: terminology, security types, debt and money markets. Attention then moves to the valuation of cash flows, term structure of interest rates and modeling of credit risk. Building on that foundation, the course then examines the key role that fixed income plays in the global financial system, other asset classes and derivatives. The course is firmly grounded in a quantitative and analytical approach, with each topic</span><span class="deschide"> placed in the relevant real world context -- for example, the role that high yield securities play in an LBO, and negotiation of bond covenants.

This course aims to improve the quality of decisions people make. Students learn to be aware of, and to avoid, common inferential errors and systematic biases in decision making. There are many decision traps that we tend to repeatedly fall into. These traps relate to how we think about risk and probability, how we learn from experience, and how we make choices. Upon completion, students will have internalized the basic principles of decision making and will be</span><span class="deschide"> able to avoid falling into these traps.

Students learn about the key strategic choices that shape whether companies deliver real value to stakeholders. They are taught to organize the strategic choices into four different strategy “playbooks” that they can use to systematically consider alternate strategies for a startup, and the core elements needed to make these strategies work: Intellectual Property Strategy, Disruptive Strategy, Value Chain Strategy, and Architectural Strategy. Students must (a) analyze</span><span class="deschide"> cases, thinking systematically through what they would do if they were a founder or early-employee in the protagonists’ shoes; (b) engage in class discussions, treating the classroom as a laboratory; and (c) formulate a real strategic plan for a final strategy assignment.</span><br />
