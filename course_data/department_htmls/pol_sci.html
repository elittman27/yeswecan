Politics is the art and noise of collective governance under conditions of scarce resources, conflicting interests, diverse beliefs, uncertain outcomes, and unequal power. In 1AC, we learn about the institutions, ideologies, and processes that constitute politics in the U.S. In fulfilling the AC requirement, we further examine how power, equality, and diversity are configured and contested in our politics.

This course aims to furnish students with the tools necessary to study political processes and outcomes in comparative perspective. It is divided into three parts. The first introduces the basic concepts and methods of comparative analysis and examines our principal unit of analysis: the state. The second surveys the range of political regimes under which people live around the world. The third examines three</span><span class="deschide"> key variables that both influence political outcomes and are influenced by political processes: institutions, identity, and agency. Throughout the course we will use a wide variety of country examples, but will not focus exclusively on any particular set of countries.</span><br />

This course provides an overview of some of the methods employed in political science research. Its purpose is to familiarize you with the scientific study of politics, and to teach you how to pose and answer<br/>
empirical research questions using appropriate evidence and arguments. Along the way we will learn about how to formulate and evaluate theories, how to design research to discover whether</span><span class="deschide"> a<br/>
particular theory holds up empirically, and some basic research strategies. By the end of the course you should have the tools to critically evaluate the kinds of social science arguments found in everyday life and be able to conduct your own independent research.</span><br />

Dêmokratia, democratia, democracy. What did this term mean to the ancient Greeks who coined it, to the Romans who borrowed it, to the early modern Europeans who discussed it—and what does it mean today? Who or what was the original dêmos, how did it rule, and how different is the interpretation of “rule by the people” that now predominates? Starting with the first attestations of da-mo in the 12 th century BC and ending with the recent attempts by Iceland and</span><span class="deschide"> Chile to reform their constitutions by crowdsourcing and a citizen convention respectively, this course offers a chronological exploration of the idea and practice of democracy, intended to broaden our imaginative horizons with respect to what democracy has been, is, and could become.</span><br />

In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular</span><span class="deschide"> culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.</span><br />

What is governance? How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979</span><span class="deschide">, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments.</span><br />

This course explores the varieties of political experience and ideas in the ancient Greek world,<br/>
focusing on the Classical era. We’ll consider different regime types (kingship, tyranny,<br/>
democracy, oligarchy), places (Athens, Sparta, Crete, Syracuse, and beyond Hellas, Persia,<br/>
Carthage, and Egypt), political forms (city-state, nation, alliance, empire), institutions (assembly,<br/>
council, courts, offices) and persons (political leader or “demagogue</span><span class="deschide">,” citizen, woman, foreign<br/>
resident, slave). The readings are broadly chronological and include a wide variety of sources:<br/>
epic and elegiac poetry, tragic and comic drama, history, inscriptions, speeches, pamphlets, and<br/>
philosophy.</span><br />

A Classical Approach to Law. This course consists of two main parts. The first part will be a standard course on Roman private law. Using Barry Nicholas’ Roman Law, students will study the essential features of classical Roman law: persons, property, successions, obligations, and actions. Students will also study basic legal problems through study of select cases, recorded in Justinian’s Digest. The second part of the course will then introduce students to major texts</span><span class="deschide"> and debates in jurisprudence, such as legal positivism, modern natural law theory, and interpretivism. This is an upper-level undergraduate course. Latin is not required, but students will be expected to learn key legal vocabulary in Latin.</span><br />

The course will examine three American cultural forms. The focus of the course is to be comparative; readings will center around first-person accounts, written by members of the ethnic groups most immediately involved in each of the cultural forms. The theme is that of identity, seen politically as well as culturally: examining how the various ethnic groups involved came to forge a collective identity for themselves.</span><span class="deschide"> The three groups studied will vary by instructor.

This course will examine the origins and forms of what a legal scholar once called an “odious scourge”: genocide. For years, genocide mainly referred to the Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jews during World War II. However, since the end of the Cold War<br/>
events in Eastern Europe, Central Africa, and elsewhere have drawn scholars’ attention to genocide as a political phenomenon that may be studied across regions and time periods. Although ethical and policy concerns</span><span class="deschide"> will underlie the discussion, as they do whenever genocide is the topic of study, our main objective will be to examine the determinants of genocide and related forms of mass violence.</span><br />

Social scientists and policymakers increasingly use large quantities of data to make<br/>
decisions and test theories. For example, political campaigns use surveys, marketing<br/>
data, and previous voting history to optimally target get out the vote drives.<br/>
Governments deploy predictive algorithms in an attempt to optimize public policy<br/>
processes and decisions. And political scientists use massive new data sets to measure<br/>
the extent of</span><span class="deschide"> partisan polarization in Congress, the sources and consequences of media<br/>
bias, and the prevalence of discrimination in the workplace. Each of these examples,<br/>

The purposes of the course are to give students a sense of the field of game theory and how political scientists use it in making arguments about how government and politics work, to develop students' intuition about strategic situations in everyday life, and to</span><span class="deschide"> develop students' analytical capabilities generally. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to depict social situations as simple game theoretic models, analyze those models to understand how the behaviors of the individuals involved are mutually reinforcing, and apply computer-based tools to evaluate under conditions of uncertainty.</span><br />

We will look at variation in gender equality indicators to systematically address how women’s socio-economic status and political power have varied across time (in historical perspective) and place (in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas). We will employ three analytical lenses to help us interpret what we see: biology</span><span class="deschide">, markets, and power.

In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into</span><span class="deschide"> these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.</span><br />

This course will examine the origins and forms of what a legal scholar once called an “odious scourge”: genocide. For years, genocide mainly referred to the Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jews during World War II. However, since the end of the Cold War events in Eastern Europe, Central Africa, and elsewhere have drawn scholars’ attention to genocide as a political phenomenon that may be studied across regions and time periods. Although ethical and policy concerns will</span><span class="deschide"> underlie the discussion, as they do whenever genocide is the topic of study, our main objective will be to examine the determinants of genocide and related forms of mass violence.</span><br />

This course starts by exploring such migration reasons and the scholarly understanding of the politics of immigration. We then move to discussing the processes of immigrant incorporation—do immigrants and their children enter the mainstream societal institutions, what are the policies that promote the social, economic and political participation of immigrants, and what are the conditions that hinder immigrants participation; including nativistic reactions to immigration</span><span class="deschide"> and demographic change. The course ends with a discussion of policy interventions designed to ameliorate the conditions hindering immigrants’ incorporation.</span><br />

Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell, metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth.

The course begins at the global level and moves to the local level in examining the nexus of politics, environment, and culture where conflicts ensue. These conflicts can lead to violence and hardship. They can also result in creative adaptations and solutions based in political and administrative institutions and processes that build peace. The first three weeks of the course examine global trends and institutions; the last three weeks examine the</span><span class="deschide"> specific dynamics involving land and resource conflict in Kenya. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to social science and environmental science perspectives. Students will be exposed to the analytical tools of political economy, history, and political ecology. The class will consist of students from the University of California, Berkeley and Kenyatta University. It will be led by faculty from both institutions.</span><br />

French political life has long gravitated around a &quot;Republican model&quot; marked by an unmediated relationship between the citizen and the state, socialization into French values through secular public education, a special vocation for France on the international stage, and an activist state. Recent developments have called the Republican model into question. This course will examine the transformation of France's Republican model - its origins</span><span class="deschide">, operations, and responses to contemporary challenges.</span><br />

This course explores the sources of political beliefs and actions through the application of psychological theories about personality, learning, cognition, and group dynamics. The course begins by briefly considering a number of alternative analytic approaches to linking human nature and politics and then considers such problems as political ideology, persuasion, compliance, protest</span><span class="deschide">, violence, and leadership in terms of these approaches. The course considers both mass and elite political behavior. The readings include both quantitative materials drawn from survey research and experiments and more impressionistic and clinical studies.</span><br />

Students will explore, discuss, and understand the relationship between racial/ethnic group formation, group-based beliefs and behavior, and politics. Our focus is on the US today, but with an appreciation of how the racial politics of the here and now is rooted in history and human psychology. We cover Black Politics, Latinx Politics, Asian American Politics, Native American Politics and White Politics, general concepts of identity, immigration, citizenship, class</span><span class="deschide">, and intersectionality. We examine both how race and ethnicity affect politics, as well as how politics can shape the boundaries, definitions and behaviors of groups. These behaviors include voting, elite decisions, civic engagement, protests, and media content and usage.</span><br />

Some of the most enduring and violent conflicts in America center on race. The goal of this course is to explore, discuss, and better understand the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, attributions of racial difference, and politics, broadly defined. We focus on the recent and persistent debates about racism, identity, rights, representation, citizenship, conflict, and coalitions. A repeated theme of this course is the question</span><span class="deschide"> whether racial order and inequality are essential to, or an exception from, the liberal democracy in the U.S. This is a lecture course with intensive readings, written assignments, and in-class discussion.</span><br />

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are</span><span class="deschide"> they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.</span><br />

New digital technologies, changing market structures, and innovative business organizations are transforming the economic and social landscape of the advanced industrial countries. The policy issues associated with this transformation pose fundamental philosophical and political questions of how to organize our markets, polity, and society.

This seminar is designed for Ph.D. students as a foundation for future research on the origins and persistence of gender inequality in politics and other positions of power.

Throughout the course, we will</span><span class="deschide"> pay particular attention to the way gender intersects with other identities, such as race, ethnicity, sexuality and class.

This graduate seminar is designed to introduce students to the comparative study of political violence. The course examines two broad themes through a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches. The first theme focuses on why individuals choose to rebel: When does violence become a strategy for resolving conflict? Why do individuals participate in violence? How is violence organized? The second theme focuses on how states choose to repress</span><span class="deschide"> citizens: When are human rights violations committed? When does a state use violence over other strategies?

This seminar provides an introduction to the major debates in comparative political economy. Although the empirical focus is on the affluent democracies, many of the debates and issues analyzed have implications for other regions. The course is divided into two main parts. The first part examines leading theoretical perspectives on political economy, such as Friedman, Marx, Weber, and Polanyi. The second part of the course is more topical. It probes</span><span class="deschide"> a number of examples of economic development, crisis, and change, with an eye to assessing alternative theoretical perspectives.</span><br />

With changes in technology, the internationalization of production and the massive increase in trans-border transactions of all kinds, it has been argued that we live and work in an era of substantively different capitalism. Were this true, it has deep implications for politics and for political economy. This graduate seminar explores the validity of this claim of a &quot;new capitalism&quot; through a variety of materials, starting with the question of whether &quot;Fordism&quot;</span><span class="deschide"> ever existed, moving on to the question of whether &quot;Post-Fordism&quot; exists and ending with a variety of ethnographic studies that show how global production chains shape culture, gender, and hieraarchy/power.</span><br />

How has religion shaped the structure of the international system? How should IR scholars approach the role that religion plays in contemporary affairs?

We will examine</span><span class="deschide"> a variety of theoretical approaches to the topic of religion and global politics, explore religious origins of the modern state system, and analyze the influence of religion on historical and comtemporary conflicts, with a particular focus on ethnic conflict, terrorism, and peacemaking.</span><br />

This course offers an introduction to the empirical analysis of International Security. The primary goals are 1) to acquaint students with the empirical knowledge in the field of International Security that has been produced with quantitative approaches and 2) to help students develop and hone their skills in empirical analysis. Therefore, particular emphasis will be given on how to go beyond being &quot;consumers&quot; of empirical research</span><span class="deschide"> and how to become &quot;producers&quot; of novel empirical knowledge.</span><br />

This seminar will cover the topic of international cooperation. We will begin by reviewing the positions of central IR paradigms on the possibility of international cooperation and the role of international institutions. We will talk about why states want to cooperate, which obstacles need to be overcome, and how international institutions can facilitate interstate cooperation. We examine questions concerning the design of international institutions, the extent</span><span class="deschide"> of compliance they evoke, and their effect in various areas of international cooperation. We also discuss how domestic politics affect a state’s willingness to cooperate and comply with international institutions.</span><br />

Civil conflict, committed primarily by non-state actors, often results in international intervention<br/>
in some form. This course, then, focuses on two themes: first, why does civil conflict occur?<br/>
What motivates individuals and groups to resort to violence? What tactics do they use? How do<br/>
they expect to succeed? Second, why do international actors intervene in civil conflict? What are<br/>
their aims in intervening? Are they successful</span><span class="deschide"> in those goals or in others?<br/></span><br />

This course presents essential methodological concepts, ideas, and tools students need to know before beginning their study of the formal and quantitative methods tools used in political science research. Topics covered include functions, limits, continuity, calculus, optimization, probability and statistics, and linear algebra.

Learn about model-based statistical inference and its applications to political science research. The course will cover multiple approaches to model-based inference. First, students will learn about maximum likelihood estimation, which proceeds by assuming the data were generated by a specified probability model. Second, students will learn a collection of methods in machine learning, which employ algorithmic models to optimize fit to the data without relying</span><span class="deschide"> on assumptions about the data mechanism. Along the way, students will learn about the strengths and limitations of these different approaches, how to interpret the outputs of different types of models, and how to assess the value of estimated models in different situations.</span><br />

This course analyzes the politics of social protection in Western Europe and the United States. After describing different national welfare regimes, we turn to contemporary challenges, notably globalization, persistent poverty, and changes in family forms and gender roles. We also look at the politics of welfare retrenchment and adjustment, paying particular attention to the prospects for progressive social policy. Must reform inevitably scale</span><span class="deschide"> back protections for the weak and vulnerable, or can equity be safeguarded while promoting efficiency?</span><br />

This course explores the implications of new strategies for coping with social problems and managing public programs. In response to growing criticism of government bureaucracy, public skepticism of expert authority, and an explosion of advocacy groups, a variety of new governance strategies have been developed. These new strategies are characterized by five broad themes: the use of markets or market mechanisms to increase efficiency; an emphasis on holding public agencies</span><span class="deschide"> accountable and making them more transparent; the development of coordinating networks to link public agencies with each other and with stakeholders; the extensive involvement of non-state organizations in all aspects of governing; and renewed attention to the civic role of individuals and communities. The course investigates the extent to which these new strategies succeed in making the governance process more efficient, accountable, effective, representative, and civic.</span><br />

This course is intended for all new graduate student instructors (GSI) in the Department of Political Science, and is meant to be taken simultaneously with the first semester of teaching as a GSI. The course functions as a participatory workshop. Although the course is intended for first-time GSIs, it is not a course in &quot;how to be a GSI,&quot; but rather, how to be an effective political science teacher, now and at later steps in professional</span><span class="deschide"> careers. Workshop time will be divided among presentations by the instructor, discussion of required readings, and discussion of weekly assignments in relation to challenges encountered by GSIs in the course of their teaching.</span><br />
