This 7.5-week course aims to bring students with varying Math backgrounds up-to-speed with the expectations of UC Berkeley’s lower division mathematics courses. This course will support comprehension of the fundamental concepts necessary to excel in Math 16A/16B, 1A/1B, 10A/10B, and beyond. You can take this prep course concurrently with or prior to your Calculus classes. The course curriculum covers algebraic operations, laws of exponents and logarithms, inequalities</span><span class="deschide"> and absolute values, single-variable function properties, polynomials, power and exponential functions, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, coordinate geometry in two and three dimensions, complex numbers, and functions of several variables.</span><br />

This is a first course in Linear Algebra. Core topics include: algebra and geometry of vectors and matrices; systems of linear equations and Gaussian elimination; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Gram-Schmidt and least squares; symmetric matrices and quadratic forms; singular value decomposition and other factorizations. Time permitting, additional topics may include: Markov chains and Perron-Frobenius, dimensionality reduction, or linear programming. This course differs</span><span class="deschide"> from Math 54 in that it does not cover Differential Equations, but focuses on Linear Algebra motivated by first applications in Data Science and Statistics.</span><br />
